Politics,"The United States House of Representatives has voted overwhelmingly to defeat an effort by Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Republican. In an unusual move, Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote on Wednesday to keep Johnson in his leadership role and stave off further turmoil in the House. “I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,” Johnson said following the vote. “Hopefully this is the end of the character assassination that has characterised the current Congress.” Hardline Representative Greene has, for weeks, sought to get Johnson kicked out after a string of compromises he made with Democrats over a   for security assistance to US allies Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Greene is a leading voice of the far-right flank opposed to helping Ukraine. After the House passed the bill in April, she called Johnson a “lame duck”. Johnson’s leadership was “pathetic, weak, and unacceptable”, Greene said on Wednesday as she triggered the “motion to vacate” measure. 		 		 The same procedure was used to remove former Republican Speaker   in October, the first time in US history that the House voted to remove its leader. Republicans have a slim 217-213 majority in the House. Most opposed the vote to remove Johnson, with only 11 in favour and 196 against. “As I’ve said from the beginning, and I’ve made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,” Johnson said. “And I’ll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.” Democrats, led by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, had promised to keep Johnson in his seat, with 163 against the motion. “Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,” Jeffries, the House Minority Leader, said after the vote. Greene’s move represented a rare Republican defiance of presumptive presidential candidate Donald Trump, who in a social media post following the House vote said it was “not the time” for Republicans to try to push out their own speaker. “This is not an individual who knows how to lead,” Republican Marcus Molinaro said of Greene after the vote. “She’s not an individual who knows how to negotiate. And she certainly doesn’t seem to have any concern for the stability of the Congress or the people we represent.” Some Republicans said she could face disciplinary action for attempting to sow disunity in the party.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/us-house-blocks-bid-to-remove-speaker-mike-johnson,Al Jazeera,US House blocks bid to remove Speaker Mike Johnson

She wants to apply for asylum in the United States, but the only way to get there is through the Darien Gap, a 106km (66-mile) stretch of remote and perilous jungle in Colombia and Panama that is the only land route for migrants heading north from South America. Amid historic regional migration and new travel restrictions from countries in Central America for migrants, the Darien Gap has become one of the most travelled migration routes in the world and a burgeoning humanitarian crisis.

Politics,"“The Chinese take great pride in their food,” read a memo prepared for United States President Richard Nixon ahead of his groundbreaking visit to the People’s Republic of China in 1972. Nixon’s lavish state banquet with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, broadcast live across the world, was crucial in improving US public opinion of a country that had been hidden from view for decades. More than half a century later, food is once again playing a central role in nurturing warmer US-China relations. With   and   both recently wrapping up their second visits to China in less than a year, meals have emerged as a key ingredient in stabilising ties between the two countries, as officials on both sides look to tap into the potential of what has been called “food diplomacy”. Yellen’s visit in early April was notable for the level of Chinese public attention on her food choices. Anticipation was high after her first visit last July, when her choice of a Beijing restaurant serving authentic food from the country’s southern Yunnan province, including mushrooms that can have psychedelic effects if cooked improperly, made her a social media darling in China. This time around, it was not only her choice of authentic Cantonese and Sichuan food that grabbed headlines but also her use of chopsticks at a popular Guangzhou restaurant established in 1880, reminiscent of Nixon’s own chopstick skills that also impressed his hosts in 1972. Although Yellen is known to sample local food during her trips around the US, the symbolic significance of doing so in China was especially pronounced, according to Thomas DuBois, a historian of China who teaches at Beijing Normal University. “In China, food is the language of diplomacy, and the Chinese are rightfully proud of their culinary culture. She [Yellen] knew that how she ate would reflect extremely heavily on her visit,” DuBois told Al Jazeera. “If you’re eating badly in China, because it’s a very food-obsessed culture, it’s more than a sign of bad taste, it’s a sign that there’s something off about you.” DuBois noted that one of the common phrases used to describe Yellen’s eating in China was “qianxu”, or humility – a character trait “extremely important” to the Chinese. “Eating well and knowing how to eat is a profound moral philosophy in China that really comes down to being humble enough to change yourself according to what needs to happen, such as coming here and using chopsticks,” he said. Food’s importance to diplomacy is well-known among foreign diplomats in China. According to a diplomat for a major European country in Beijing, eating together is one of the top priorities when interacting with Chinese officials. “In high-level bilateral meetings, it’s incredibly important to have an eating element in the programme because that’s where you can have an open and frank conversation,” he said, preferring not to be named. “The dinners are used strategically on both sides to create a trusted relationship,” he said. Before the diplomat was posted to Beijing, part of his training related to Chinese banquet customs, including who sits where at the table and the rules surrounding toasting. Ministers from his country are also briefed on these customs before they have meetings with their Chinese counterparts, he added. Even so, banquets can be tricky affairs. In addition to complicated customs, the complex nature of Chinese cuisine, which uses a wide range of ingredients, can lead to challenges in establishing rapport over food, especially with food allergies, which are relatively uncommon in China. At a recent banquet in Beijing arranged by the Chinese, each visiting European minister had a different allergy, from lactose intolerance to shellfish. “A Chinese staffer came over and told me that they had such difficulty planning this dinner for us because our ministers have so many different allergies,” the diplomat said. “These differences in eating habits can complexify things and create lots of stress and anxiety.” The viral seven-second video of Yellen’s chopstick skills was first posted by a social media account believed to be run directly by Beijing. Multiple state-run outlets published the full details of Yellen’s food itinerary, including all the dishes she ate. In an essay on the popular Chinese app WeChat, veteran commentator and former journalist Zhang Feng noted that Chinese state media coverage of Yellen’s more endearing side was a departure from the “cold” reporting on US officials in recent years. “Yellen’s trip to China may somewhat improve the anti-American sentiment of ordinary Chinese people,” Zhang wrote. Chinese public opinion of the US sharply deteriorated during the Donald Trump presidency, who famously ate “Americanised” Chinese food during his state visit in 2017, rebounding slightly since President Joe Biden took office. The warmer coverage is consistent with the Chinese state media’s   on US-China relations in recent months as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) looks to stabilise bilateral relations amid domestic economic challenges. The practice has historical roots. Chinese officials also used food to improve perceptions of the US in the run-up to Nixon’s visit in 1972. Photos of Americans friendly to the regime, such as journalist Edgar Snow, attending various state banquets were widely circulated in both national and internal party newspapers. However, there has also been nationalist pushback against the recent softening of rhetoric. The outspoken tabloid Global Times said in an editorial that “[t]he Chinese people welcome anyone from anywhere to come and enjoy our food, but that does not mean we won’t push back against groundless accusations and outright crackdowns”. Another vocal critic, former Xinhua News Agency journalist Ming Jinwei, accused compatriots of being “hopelessly enamoured” with the US in a WeChat essay and referred to them as “spiritual Americans”. He claimed that the reputation of the US is now “bankrupt” in China, which he described as “a good thing”. The debate over how the CCP should shape domestic opinion towards the US was on display in the much frostier reception Blinken received during his visit in late April, which included meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. While Blinken also ate in authentic restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing, with the US embassy even sharing a clip of him with a popular Chinese food vlogger showing off his chopstick skills, his eating habits received far less attention than Yellen’s. The social media account that had enthused about Yellen’s ability to use chopsticks did not share any videos of Blinken’s culinary adventures. Instead, it emphasised Chinese talking points about the US’s “wrong words and deeds” on various red-line issues at the centre of US-China tensions, including  , the  , and  . On Weibo, China’s equivalent of X, one of the most discussed topics during Blinken’s three-day visit was an interview with the BBC in Beijing in which he was subject to tough questioning over US support for  . The related hashtag for the interview broke into the site’s top 10 most discussed topics on April 28, amassing more than 67 million views as of Tuesday. In contrast, multiple hashtags about Yellen’s eating habits had amassed a total of 39 million views. It is unclear whether the BBC interview went viral organically. Weibo has been accused of rigging its hashtag ranking system before, with hashtags relating to international Politics prone to manipulation. On Saturday evening, the Shanghai restaurant that Blinken visited was about 80 percent full. A staff member said the restaurant’s location in a tourist hotspot meant that they were always busy and that Blinken’s visit had not led to a spike in customers. Nonetheless, other countries have also recognised the power of food diplomacy. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron thanked the visiting Xi after an hours-long meeting in Paris for his “openness“ to not imposing preemptive tariffs on French cognac. Beijing had launched an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy in January, viewed by some as a response to a European Union probe on Chinese electric vehicles. Macron later took Xi and his wife to the Pyrenees, where they nibbled on cheese and enjoyed some wine. And what did Macron’s going-away gift for Xi include? Two bottles of cognac, of course.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/how-food-and-chopstick-skills-are-helping-ease-us-china-tensions,Al Jazeera,How food and chopstick skills are helping ease US-China tensions
Politics,"– Troops from the United States and the Philippines have launched Javelin missiles and fired howitzers to simulate repelling a maritime invasion along the coast of the South China Sea, in a show of force capping joint war games held in China’s maritime back yard. The live fire exercises were held throughout the week along the shores of the coastal city of Laoag in northern Ilocos province, the closest mainland Philippine province to China. They capped the largest ever Balikatan, or “shoulder-to-shoulder,” joint military exercises between US and Philippine troops, cementing a dramatic policy shift that has seen Washington and Manila become close allies since Ferdinand Marcos Jr became president in 2022. Tensions have risen amid multiple confrontations between Philippine vessels and the China Coast Guard in the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire area under its nine-dash line, which was rejected by an international tribunal in 2016. While the US and Philippine militaries would not name their adversaries, this year’s exercises were concentrated around the northern and western shores of the Philippines — close to the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Parts of the drills were also staged in waters outside the Philippines’ 19km (12-mile) territorial limit, and also outside Manila’s exclusive economic zone, which extends for 200 nautical miles (about 370km). “The Philippines and US have a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” US Marines Lieutenant General Michael Cederholm, commander of the Balikatan joint task force, told reporters on Monday. “It’s grounded in the seeking of peaceful solutions. “Make no mistake, if there can’t be a peaceful solution, we have an obligation to our countries to train together.” Ilocos province lies southeast of China and just south of Taiwan, near areas of the South China Sea that would probably be at the centre of any regional conflict over the disputed waters. The US and Philippine militaries fired missiles and used howitzer guns stationed along the shore to sink five platoons standing in for amphibious warships. In northern Batanes, an island province just south of Taiwan, US and Philippine forces simulated the recapture of  . The war games elicited a strong response from China, which managed to disrupt at least one live fire exercise in the South China Sea. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera. A Chinese warship and two other vessels   as the exercises were held, the Philippine Coast Guard said on Wednesday. The ships left after the coastguard issued a challenge over the radio. This year’s exercises also showcased new US weapons that could be stationed in the Philippines during a conflict. For the first time in the Asia Pacific, the US military deployed a new mid-range missile launcher, called the Typhon. From the northern Philippines, it is able to reach targets in Taiwan, along with Chinese bases and infrastructure in the South China Sea and mainland China. It is the first such weapon deployed in the region since the US withdrew in 2019 from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that barred the development of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 2,500km. While the Typhon system was not fired during Balikatan, its deployment now serves to identify launch sites that can be used during a conflict, said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “During wartime, all you need to do is just go straight to these launch sites and you can set it up and fire immediately without further preparation,” Koh said. The US and Philippine militaries also used a hovercraft to land a HIMARS missile system on the western island of Palawan, close to contested areas of the South China Sea. Last year, the militaries tried and failed to land a HIMARS system at the main port of Batanes. This year, the US military  , along with a warehouse and other military infrastructure, as part of an effort to develop functional seaports to offload equipment and troops. “The longer you stay in the port, the more vulnerable you are,” Koh said. “When you are unloading all your equipment and your troops, that is when you are exposed essentially as a sitting duck.” Last year, Washington and Manila announced that four military bases would be added to the  , allowing US troops to utilise a total of nine military sites in the Philippines for training, refuelling and other operations. Three of those bases are in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, both close to the Luzon Strait running between the Philippines and Taiwan. The increasing presence of military troops in civilian areas has alarmed some civilians, worried their location puts them in the path of any future war between the US and China. “We don’t have to choose between the two,” said Manuel Mamba, governor of Cagayan province. “I do not like foreign forces in my province because I feel we could be dragged into a war which is not ours.” Mamba has vocally opposed the development of bases in his province for US troops and is among a small yet stubborn contingent of regional and local politicians who have resisted Manila’s turn towards Washington. Marcos Jr’s predecessor Rodrigo Duterte was  . Cagayan has received substantial investment from Chinese companies, including an ongoing effort to dredge and develop an international port in the coastal town of Aparri. The US military builds schools and distributes humanitarian aid during its yearly Balikatan exercises, but Washington has never competed dollar for dollar with the investment promises Beijing can make to local politicians. Last month, the US and the Philippines announced a new economic investment corridor in Luzon focused on ports, railways and clean energy. Such US investment would be welcome in Cagayan “if it is not military in nature”, Mamba said. “Maybe [it could be used] only by the Armed Forces of the Philippines if there’s an emergency.” In Laoag, where live-fire exercises were held, fishermen were ordered not to sail for more than one week. The order cost some fishing boats up to $60 per day in lost income, said Arvin Mangrubang, a priest at the Laoag branch of the Iglesia Filipino Independiente church. Some communities gave relief stipends of about $9 per day to families that are registered to vote, which Mangrubang said is hardly enough to cover the cost of the exercises to working families. “We cannot gain anything from that,” he said. “If China reacts to these exercises, the Filipino people will suffer.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/philippines-us-simulate-mock-invasions-in-largest-ever-war-games,Al Jazeera,"Philippines, US simulate mock invasions in largest ever war games"
Politics,"On May 5, the breaking news that Hamas had accepted a ceasefire deal spread like wildfire across Gaza, sending people to the streets celebrating. Their joy was short-lived, however, as Israel pressed forward with a deadly ground assault on Rafah. After weeks of facing accusations from Israel and the US that its stance was impeding progress in ceasefire negotiations, Hamas made a strategic decision with which it effectively outmanoeuvred its enemy. The ball is now in Israel’s court and by extension, the court of its main backer, the United States. If a deal for a lasting ceasefire is not concluded, Israel will be exposed as the true spoiler of peace, and US as a dishonest broker. There are already indications that the two are playing a game, trying to sell to the global public unconvincing narratives that Israel was not aware of the deal that was proposed to Hamas and that the US opposes an Israeli operation of Rafah. Despite the appearance of public surprise and puzzlement by both, it may well be that they knew and expected what would happen next. Israel has claimed that it is rejecting the deal because it was not aware of new provisions included in it, and yet there are reports that CIA chief Bill Burns who is involved in the negotiations has been briefing the Israeli side. And given President Joe Biden’s “ironclad” support for Israel, it seems highly unlikely his administration would negotiate a deal that does not favour its ally’s interests. The US, for its part, has claimed that it staunchly opposes an Israeli ground offensive on Gaza. And yet, the operation has started and the response from the Biden administration has been to  , not to denounce it. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby   supposedly this was not the full invasion everyone expected, but a “limited” operation, thus indirectly indicating that the US was aware of Israeli plans. In this context, it is important to remember another “limited” operation that the US reportedly opposed, and which turned out to be not so “limited”. At the start of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, then-Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin claimed the Israeli army would enter only 40km (25 miles) into Lebanese territory, to “eliminate” positions of Palestinian armed groups that had bombarded northern Israel. Unsurprisingly, the Israeli troops did not stop at 40km and advanced all 110km (68 miles) to the capital Beirut and captured it. Trying to cover up its deceit, the Israeli government claimed the full-scale invasion was necessary due to the “situation on the ground” – a weak justification that even then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig repeated. The Israelis did not withdraw from Lebanon until 2000. Throughout this Israeli war on Gaza, there hasn’t been a warning publicly made by the US that Israel has heeded. It is indeed unclear to what extent such warnings are just optics of putting pressure on the Israeli government while continuing to support its every move. In this sense, one should take with a grain of salt reports that the Biden administration is holding off   of weapons to Israel to pressure it into halting the full-scale invasion of Rafah. Within the context of this supposedly “limited” operation, it is worrying the US is giving tacit approval for Israeli forces occupying the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The Israeli takeover of the Palestinian crossing point not only caused panic in Gaza, where people are terrified of badly needed aid being completely blocked, but also deeply worried Cairo, which condemned the attack. Egypt has repeatedly warned in the past that any presence of Israeli military troops on the Palestinian side of the   Corridor is a violation of the Camp David Accords and Philadelphi protocol, according to which this area has to be demilitarised. The Camp David Peace treaty between Israel and Egypt was brokered and guaranteed by the US in 1979. It was later amended with the Philadelphi protocol in 2005 after Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Egypt has abided by the provisions of the deal, but now Israel appears not to be. The Biden administration may be thinking it is successfully deflecting criticism by presenting the Israeli invasion of Rafah as “limited”, but the occupation of the crossing in violation of a US-backed treaty sends a clear message that the US and Israel have no qualms about walking all over agreements they have signed. This comes on top of Washington going out of its way to shield Israel from legal consequences for the atrocities it is committing in Gaza, thus undermining international law. US officials have called UN Security Council resolutions “not binding”, condemned the International Court of Justice for recognising the situation in Gaza as a “plausible” genocide, and threatened the International Criminal Court with sanctions if it issues arrest warrants for Israeli officials. As things stand now, Biden is headed towards losing the November election and leaving a dreadful legacy behind: overseeing a genocide in Gaza and undermining the international legal order to pave the way for more atrocities and more impunity. It is still not too late to change course. Biden must apply real, decisive pressure on Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire deal with Hamas, fully withdraw from Gaza, lift the siege and allow for full humanitarian access and reconstruction to begin.",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/5/8/the-us-and-israel-are-playing-a-dangerous-game,Al Jazeera,The US and Israel are playing a dangerous game
Politics,"Donald Trump’s defence team has finished its cross-examination of adult film star Stormy Daniels, the most high-profile witness to testify so far in the former United States president’s New York criminal trial. Daniels’s   with Trump in 2006 riveted jurors this week and served as a reminder of the more lurid aspects of the trial, which takes place as Trump, a real estate developer-turned-politician, campaigns for reelection. On Thursday, Trump lawyer Susan Necheles grilled Daniels on the transaction at the centre of Trump’s hush money trial. Necheles pressed Daniels on why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. “Why didn’t you do that?” Necheles asked, questioning why Daniels didn’t hold a news conference in 2016, as she had initially planned, to tell reporters about her alleged encounter with Trump. “Because we were running out of time,” Daniels said. 		 		 Necheles asked if she meant that she was running out of time to use the claim to make money. “To get the story out,” Daniels countered. Trump has denied any sexual relations with Daniels. But the alleged deal to buy her silence happened in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, a critical point in the case because   that Trump and his allies buried potentially damaging stories to influence the election results. The former president   of falsifying business records pertaining to the alleged hush-money payment made to silence Daniels. Trump, the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee in November’s election, denies any wrongdoing. Daniels’s testimony marked an extraordinary moment in what could be the only criminal case against Trump to go to trial before voters decide whether to send him back to the White House. He faces  , including two that relate to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The trial date in one of those cases — over Trump’s handling of classified documents — was postponed indefinitely earlier this week. In the New York hush money case, Daniels testified on Thursday that, as she negotiated a nondisclosure agreement with Trump’s  , she was also talking with journalists as a “backup” plan. Necheles accused her of refusing to share the story with reporters because she wouldn’t be paid for it. “The better alternative was for you to get money, right?” Necheles said. Daniels said she was most interested in getting her story out and ensuring her family’s safety. “The better alternative was to get my story protected with a paper trail so that my family didn’t get hurt,” Daniels replied. Later, Daniels said in court that she never spoke with Trump about   she received from Cohen and had no knowledge of whether Trump was aware of or involved in the transaction. Necheles, Trump’s lawyer, also asked Daniels if she was aware of what Trump had been indicted for, producing an uncomfortable answer that the defence wanted stricken from the record: “There’s a lot of indictments.” Daniels went on to say that she knew the charges involved business records, but when asked if she knew anything about Trump’s business records, she acknowledged: “I know nothing about his business records. No. Why would I?” Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization when Trump was president, and Madeleine Westerhout — his personal secretary from 2017 to 2019 and the former director of Oval Office Operations from February to August 2019 — also took the stand on Thursday. Manochio testified about how cheques were sent to the White House for Trump to sign from his personal account, and Westerhout provided the White House’s perspective on that arrangement. Westerhout said Trump would receive packages about twice a month — some containing one check and others with a stack about a half-inch thick. The checks were often attached to invoices stating what the payment was for. 		 		 Before the lunch break on Thursday, another Trump lawyer, Todd Blanche, announced the defence would renew its motion for a mistrial, on the basis that Daniels’s testimony would prejudice the jury against their client. After the witnesses and jury were dismissed for the day, the defence team proceeded to do just that, pressing Judge Juan Merchan to void the trial. Earlier in the week, on Tuesday, Trump’s lawyers also sought a mistrial, saying that Daniels had “inflamed” the jury with unnecessary details about her alleged sexual encounter with the ex-president. On Thursday, they once again put forth their argument that Daniels’s experiences had nothing to do with a case that was primarily about business records. But Merchan dismissed their motion a second time, saying it was the defence’s responsibility to issue objections during any testimony they felt was inappropriate. “There were many times — not once or twice, but many times — when Ms Necheles could’ve objected but didn’t,” Merchan said of Trump’s defence team. He also underscored that some details were important for establishing Daniels’s credibility. “The more specificity Ms Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh about whether the encounter did occur and if so, whether they choose to credit Ms Daniels’s story,” he said. The defence also sought to challenge Judge Merchan’s gag order on Trump as it relates to the adult film star. They argued that, if Daniels could speak about Trump from the witness stand, he should be able to speak about her. But Merchan brushed aside the defence’s request, indicating it could intimidate future witnesses. “My concern is not just with protecting Ms Daniels or a witness who has already testified. My concern is with protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole,” Merchan said. The judge had previously imposed a gag order prohibiting Trump from publicly attacking witnesses, jury members and other figures related to the trial. The former president has   and held in contempt of court 10 times for violating the order. Speaking to reporters on his way into court on Thursday, Trump called the trial a “Frankenstein case” and questioned its merits. “It’s not a recognisable crime that any of us have seen,” he said of the charges against him. “This is a prosecutor making it up as he goes along.” As he left, Trump renewed his criticism of the case, specifically attacking Judge Merchan for failing to declare a mistrial. “This judge, what he did and what his ruling was — is — a disgrace,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/trumps-lawyer-presses-stormy-daniels-on-day-14-of-hush-money-trial,Al Jazeera,Trump’s lawyer presses Stormy Daniels on day 14 of hush money trial
Politics,"Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday. New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden. Indiana exploited Brunson’s absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup. But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter. The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory. Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece. Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points. Jalen Brunson lights it up in Game 2, scoring 24 of his 29 PTS in the 2nd half propelling the   to the 2-0 series lead! Game 3 is Friday at 7pm/et on ESPN. OG Anunoby: 28 PTS (playoff career high), 4 3PM Josh Hart: 19 PTS, 15 REB, 7 AST Donte DiVincenzo: 28 PTS & 6 3PM…  — NBA (@NBA)  “We found a way, that’s it,” said an exhausted Brunson. “For us it starts with our habits — we’ve talked about doing the little things from day one a little bit better, because you never know when they’re going to help you in a big game. “It’s all about doing the little things well every single day, and we pride ourselves on that.” The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic. As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem. Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth-quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm’s length. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed the team were uncertain of whether Brunson would continue after missing the second quarter. “We didn’t know if he was going to be able to go or not, but he found a way to get it done,” Thibodeau said. Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana’s scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks’ Hartenstein. Carlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated. “I’m always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,” Carlisle said. “There’s not a consistent balance and that’s disappointing.

Politics,"Student protests against the Israeli war on Gaza have rocked the United States over the past few weeks, prompting a   on many campuses and more than 2,000 arrests. Students who have set up protest encampments at universities across the country are calling for their institutions to withdraw all investments from firms complicit in Israeli abuses against Palestinians. While the focus has been on Columbia University in New York and other elite Ivy League institutions, students are also   in the US South. Smaller Southern cities were at the heart of the 1960s civil rights movement, but today, like then, protesters operate in a particularly hostile, even violent environment. In New Orleans, the largest city in Louisiana, protests have taken place on university campuses and on the city’s streets. On April 28 for a few hours, the campus encampment movement spilled into the city centre. A few dozen protesters set up green tents in Jackson Square, demanding the city, too, divest from Israel. This was the first time the encampment movement had spread beyond universities in New Orleans. It signalled a desire on the part of protesters to amplify their message – even before Israel seized control of the   and intensified its bombing on Monday in preparation for a potentially imminent ground assault on an already devastated area where more than 1.4 million Palestinians, including 600,000 children, are sheltering. “It’s overdue,” said Kinsey, a supporter of the off-campus encampment who gave only their first name. “It’s been bubbling [up]. The tides were already shifting. That pressure has been building. We’ve used our words. We’ve chanted and marched and been ignored. So now, solidarity encampments are the bare minimum.” 		 		 The Jackson Square encampment, which was not claimed by any one organisation, was occupied by a mix of about 40 local artists, builders and service industry workers. Sprawled on the grass, the protesters made demands that echoed that of the student movement: They called for the city to divest from Israeli companies and institutions deemed to be profiting from the war on Gaza. The Port of New Orleans was one institution singled out after it entered into a partnership with Israel’s Port of Ashdod last year. The protesters sat on the ground at the heart of the city’s French Quarter during one of the city’s busiest tourist weekends when it was hosting its annual Jazz and Heritage Festival. The goal, one protester said, was not necessarily to stay indefinitely – he just hoped police would allow them to stay overnight. Passing tourists snapped photos. Protesters played music and shared food. About a dozen police officers stood nearby, seemingly unsure about how to force them to dismantle. But as night fell a few hours later, things changed. Police announced the park was closed and ordered protesters to leave. When they refused, officers began to grab and then tackle protesters, chasing and arresting 12 people. Three protesters were taken to hospital, two with broken bones. Police used Tasers on several people, at least one of whom was handcuffed on the ground at the time. One of those arrested appeared in court the next day in a wheelchair due to injuries allegedly inflicted by police and told Al Jazeera that officers broke his leg with a baton. Another suffered a skull fracture, according to a press release issued by some of the protesters. The charges levelled against those arrested are more severe than what students have typically faced. Two protesters are being charged with a “hate crime against law enforcement”, a charge created in Louisiana in 2016, the equivalent of which exists in just a handful of US states. Undeterred, a campus encampment sprang up the next day. Students were already planning the encampment at Tulane University, a private university miles across town, before they heard about the off-campus protest in the city centre, they said. Taking responsibility for protests in Louisiana exposes organisers to great legal risks. A recent court decision means protest organisers can be held liable for the actions of participants. It is also, according to a decades-old state law, illegal to wear masks in public. A pair of bills working their way through the Louisiana State Legislature, 70 percent of whose seats are held by conservative Republicans, would give motorists the right to run over protesters blocking roads if drivers feel they are in danger. Another would make it a crime to be within 25ft (7.6 metres) of a working officer. Antiwar organisers at Tulane have faced an uphill battle from the start, students said. “Tulane is one of the most deeply connected institutions to …Israel,” said Kristin Hamilton, a Tulane graduate student. The school leads one of four US-Israel Energy Centers, collaborating with Israeli universities and an Israeli fossil fuel company to research and develop gas extraction. When students gathered to set up tents on their campus on April 29, police officers, some on horseback, immediately began tearing them down, the students said. Brenna Byrne, a former student at Tulane, said she saw a police horse’s hooves nearly come down on the head of one student who had been detained on the ground. Afraid the student would be killed, she moved forward to help and saw her own sister, Hannah, also on the ground and being arrested, a police officer kneeling on her head. She and five others were arrested. But suddenly, the police backed off. Dozens, then hundreds of young people came to the encampment, located between a main thoroughfare and the university president’s office. Students played music, made signs, sang and chanted, “Hold the line for Palestine.” The camp had snacks, a literature table and a 10ft (3-metre) watermelon puppet in a dress – the watermelon having become a widely used symbol for the Palestinian flag. Members of the public came out to drop off supplies. By the next day, a billboard-sized LED sign had been erected, blasting loud music and displaying a message that warned protesters they were trespassing. Demonstrators as well as a Tulane facilities worker and police present at the site said they believed it was set up by university authorities. The music drowned out attempts by groups of Jewish and Muslim protesters to perform prayers throughout the afternoon. Despite the threat of dispersal, the mood was upbeat. Silas Gillett, a Jewish sophomore, said: “Multiple people came up to us and said they felt more safe that day than they ever had on campus. Tulane is, usually, a very hostile place for Palestinians, Muslims and students of colour.” Hamilton recalled people dancing dabke, a traditional Palestinian folk dance, that night, even as police gathered nearby. “To see that Palestinian joy happening at the exact same time the state was trying to oppress and terrorise us – that was really powerful.” The camp lasted 33 hours. On May 1 at 3am, more than 100 state troopers in riot gear and backed by armoured vehicles stormed the encampment and arrested 14 students. “It was overwhelming,” Hamilton recalled. Video footage reviewed by Al Jazeera shows state police pushing Hamilton to the ground, and the student shared medical records showing they were later diagnosed with a concussion as a result of assault. The student believes they were targeted because they were filming the police at the time. In another video reviewed, an officer pulls a weapon believed to be a bean-bag rifle and aims it point-blank at nearby students. Students described the police response as “traumatic”. The police reaction to the Tulane encampment appeared far more organised than the response to the Jackson Square protest: More than 100 state troopers in riot gear moved in one coordinated skirmish line to dismantle the Tulane camp as opposed to the Jackson Square arrests, which were initiated by about a dozen local officers A lawyer who was acting as a liaison between the Tulane protesters and police said law enforcement “could have de-escalated, but they chose riot gear”. The liaison, who asked not to be identified to prevent retaliation, has acted as a legal observer at dozens of protests over various issues in Louisiana but said, “Everything about this one was different.” The aggression displayed by “the police was like nothing I’ve seen at any protests before”, the liaison added. “It was a militarisation.” But the reaction towards the demonstrations does not necessarily mean that protesters will not take to the streets in New Orleans again. Protesters said that while Tulane is hostile towards Palestinians, pro-Palestinian sentiment is still strong in the city. Gillett attributed it in part to New Orleans’s predominantly Black and lower-income population. There is also a significant Palestinian population in the area involved in protesting, and this year, a Palestinian New Orleanian, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17, was killed when he was shot in the head by the Israeli army near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, said that in the US, “brown and Black communities and poorer folks are more supportive of Palestine. And I think the reason is that Palestine is an anti-colonial movement.” Polling has consistently found Black Americans to be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than white Americans. “I think we’re seeing that the Palestine movement [is] strongest in places where there’s also a broader, multiracial working class.” “This is absolutely a class issue,” Hannah Byrne said. That also means that when authorities turn their power on the protesters, students from racial minorities and lower-income backgrounds often suffer the most. On April 30, for example, Gillet was notified that he had been suspended from Tulane along with seven other students and evicted from his student housing due to his involvement in the encampment, pending a hearing. He said most of the students he had organised the protests with were on needs-based scholarships. He also has a scholarship, and his suspension may force him to leave school. The actions of the police and university administration can be viewed as part of a wider climate at Tulane and in Louisiana that has viewed pro-Palestinian sentiment with suspicion and even as a threat. The State Legislature on Wednesday advanced a bill that doubles down on backing for Israel, calling for support for “the nation of Israel in the wake of the October 7, 2023, terror attacks and Israel’s ongoing efforts to root out Hamas”. Even before the nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian protests, demonstrators were arrested at a Tulane rally in October, and in March, Tulane Professor and former CNN CEO Walter Isaacson was filmed pushing a protesting student. The majority of Americans under 30 want a   in Gaza, according to polling data. As Israel presses on with “ironclad” support from the US, what will the Gaza protest movement come to look like? “I don’t think the protest is starting in university campuses and spilling over,” Abdelhadi said. “I would say the direction has flowed the opposite way,” from the public onto campuses. Abdelhadi pointed to past civil rights movements where she said there “wasn’t one specific action that changed everything”. Instead, in her view, it was “a combination of all the actions, all the tactics”. Until Israel’s war in Gaza ends, the anger among pro-Palestinian protesters and their desire for change are unlikely to go away. “Although we have been suspended, that does not mean we will be giving up,” said Maya Sanchez, another Tulane student involved in the encampment. “As Israel and its violence escalates, so does our commitment to fight for a liberated Palestine.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/8/in-the-us-south-pro-palestinians-face-crackdown-on-campus-and-in-streets-2,Al Jazeera,"In the US South, pro-Palestinians face crackdown on campus and in streets"
Politics,"On Wednesday, May 8, United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin became the first senior administration official to   that the US government has uncharacteristically paused a weapons shipment to Israel. Over the past seven months, the Israeli military has killed some 35,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip with solid US backing. Speaking at a Senate subcommittee hearing, Secretary Austin remarked that the pause takes place “in the context of unfolding events in Rafah”, the city in southern Gaza where an  , including more than 600,000 children, are currently sheltering. The majority of these people were forced to flee to Rafah from other parts of Gaza, in keeping with Israel’s modus operandi of making Palestinians refugees over and over again. And while Rafah has   the terror and slaughter that have characterised the past seven months of Israeli operations in the coastal enclave as a whole, the threat of a   on a mass of trapped civilians in the city has made even the global superpower – Israel’s devoted BFF – a bit squeamish. To that end, news reports began emerging over the weekend that the Joe Biden administration had undertaken to suspend a shipment to Israel of munitions that might be used in a Rafah offensive. The shipment was   of 3,500 bombs, of which 1,800 were of the 2,000-pound (907kg) variety and 1,700 were in the 500-pound (227kg) category. Certain other weapons transfers to Israel were also said to be under review. Of course, given that the US has been actively abetting genocide and   in Gaza for well over half a year with all manner of munitions and money, it’s not exactly clear why the case of Rafah should suddenly elicit such imperial concern. But, hey, it’s potentially good PR. Prior to Secretary Austin’s remarks on Wednesday, US officials had been noncommittal about the reports of a suspended weapons shipment. In a May 6  , for example, National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby flat-out refused to confirm whether or not the reports were correct, instead announcing: “All I can tell you is that … our support for Israel’s security remains ironclad. And I’m not going to get into the specifics of – of one shipment over another.” Indeed, it appears that “ironclad” is the US political establishment’s new favourite word when it comes to   support for Israel – which means that, at the end of the day, Israel’s habit of massacring Palestinians will always be defended over the right of Palestinians to not be massacred. Meanwhile, Kirby’s comment about “one shipment over another” is telling, to say the least. After all, there are a whole lot of US weapons shipments to Israel – and holding up delivery of 3,500 bombs hardly constitutes a betrayal of the Israeli killing machine, as some more dramatic members of the US right wing have chosen to portray it. For starters, Secretary Austin emphasised during his Senate subcommittee appearance that the paused weapons shipment will not affect the   in supplemental aid to Israel that the US Congress approved in April. This is on top of the various billions of dollars already provided annually to Israel by the US – most of which money, the Council on Foreign Relations  , “is provided as grants under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, funds that Israel must use to purchase U.S. military equipment and services”. Nor will the suspension impact the additional $827m worth of military goodies that the Biden administration has just authorised for Israel. In other words, it is mostly business as usual – kind of the equivalent of giving somebody hundreds of dollars on a daily basis and then making a show of withholding five cents.  the US Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, the US government is obligated to “prevent … arms transfers that risk facilitating or otherwise contributing to violations of human rights or international humanitarian law”. And yet, what is US foreign policy itself if not one big violation of all of that? Even prior to the 2001 launch of the massive global violation known as the “War on Terror”, the US had already spent decades enabling mass bloodshed from Latin America to the Middle East and beyond. In the particular case of Israel, consistent US support for the wanton violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in Palestine and   makes you wonder why anyone ever bothered writing up a Conventional Arms Transfer Policy in the first place. Now Secretary Austin, too, has reaffirmed the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to Israel even in the face of the paused munitions shipment – which just goes to underscore the largely cosmetic nature of the move, and the perceived need to project some degree of humanitarian awareness and concern. Biden himself also chimed in on Wednesday with a warning that he will not be supplying offensive weapons to Israel in the event of an all-out assault on Rafah, noting that “civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs”. Well, yeah. Genocide is genocide. And give or take a few thousand bombs, US complicity in that genocide is totally ironclad.",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/5/9/give-or-take-a-few-bombs-us-complicity-in-genocide-remains-ironclad,Al Jazeera,"Give or take a few bombs, US complicity in genocide remains ‘ironclad’"
Politics,"The United States has halted the shipment of some types of heavy bombs to Israel and US President Joe Biden has also pledged to halt the supply of some offensive weapons and artillery shells to the country if it goes ahead with its assault on Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah. Here’s what we know so far. Biden issued this warning, possibly his starkest yet against Israel, during an interview with CNN on Wednesday. In the same interview, he also said that the US would continue to supply defensive arms such as   interceptors, underlining his continued support for Israel’s defence. US officials said on Wednesday that the US had paused a shipment of heavy bombs, including 1,800 of 2,000-pound (907kg) bombs and 1,700 of 500-pound (227kg) bombs. The Washington-based news outlet, Politico, reported that the weapons held back also include Boeing’s Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which are guidance kits that convert “dumb” bombs dropped in free-fall, ballistic trajectory into precision-guided, “smart bombs”. Zoran Kusovac, a military analyst, explained: “The dumb bomb – basically you drop it from the plane and it falls much in the same way as it did in World War One and World War Two and Vietnam. “Smart bombs have additional elements: they have a smart nose that seeks the target. And It identifies it and they have the smart back that basically, guides the bomb to the target or gives it additional power to fly longer distances.” These weapons had been included in an earlier shipment for Israel, approved before the recent   authorised by the US Congress in April, which assigned $26.38bn for Israel, including $9.1bn for humanitarian purposes. At a US Senate hearing on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US is reviewing near-term security assistance to Israel in the context of Israel’s ongoing attacks on Rafah. “We’ve been very clear…from the very beginning that Israel shouldn’t launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battle space,” Austin said. On explosion, a 500-pound bomb can severely harm or kill everything or anyone within a   (65 feet) radius. A 2,000-pound bomb has a destruction radius of 35 metres (115 feet), according to the Project on Defense Alternatives (PDA), which conducts defence policy research and analysis. Depending on the type of surfaces it hits, a 500-pound bomb can create a crater of, on average, 25 feet (7.6 metres) across and 8.5 feet (2.6 metres) deep. A 2000-pound bomb will carve out a crater 50 feet (15 metres) across and 16 feet (5 metres), according to the  . A 2015 report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says of the 2000-pound bomb: “The pressure from the explosion can rupture lungs, burst sinus cavities and tear off limbs hundreds of metres from the blast site.” Israeli forces used 2,000-pound bombs on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31, according to analysis by The Guardian and The New York Times. Two impact craters estimated to be 40 feet (12 metres) wide were identified. Aerial bombing in densely populated areas is not explicitly illegal in international humanitarian law. However, civilians cannot be targets of the bombing and any civilian casualties must be “proportionate” with a specific military aim. Both the Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Hague Convention of 1907 lay down these rules. Israel is a signatory to both. If the numbers of civilian casualties are not proportionate and are “clearly excessive” as measured against any direct military advantage, then the attack qualifies as a war crime according to the statute of the International Criminal Court, which is investigating Israel’s war on Gaza. Israel asserts that its only interest is in destroying Hamas and that it does not target Palestinian civilians. It claims to take all precautions to avoid unnecessary casualties. It has justified its assault on Rafah with the claim that the city is home to Hamas’s remaining battalions. More than one million civilians have taken shelter there from the Israeli bombardment on other parts of the Gaza Strip over the past seven months, however. On Thursday, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations told Israeli public radio Kan: “This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war.” Erdan said Biden’s warning would bolster the positions of Iran, Hamas and  . “If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?” he said. The US sends Israel about $3bn a year, most of which is provided as Foreign Military Financing (FMF). The US has historically supplied substantial foreign aid to Israel; a total of $297bn (adjusted for inflation) between 1946 and 2023, $216bn of which was in military aid and $81bn in economic aid, according to data from the US Agency for International Aid (USAID). Israel is the   of US aid since its founding. After the Hamas attack on October 7, the   navy ships such as guided missile cruisers armed with naval guns and destroyers alongside $2bn worth of munitions to Israel. Israel is reliant on US military aid because of a global ammunition shortage following the wars in Gaza and  , Israeli daily business newspaper, the Calcalist reported, adding that while the Israeli military has avoided conceding this in public, Major General Eliezer Toledano admitted in March that the army is reducing air attacks in order “to better manage the economy of armaments”. Military analyst Zoran Kusovac said: “Israel has been expending its bombs from the very beginning at a very very high rate. Analysts always believe that Israel cannot sustain the initial rate of bombing and at a certain point that actually happens.” Yes. The US paused military aid to Israel in 1982, when then-President Ronald Reagan imposed a six-year ban on cluster weapons sales to Israel. This followed a congressional investigation which revealed that Israel had used the weapons on areas with civilian populations when it invaded Lebanon in 1982. Israel launched a military offensive on Rafah and   of the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, cutting off access to humanitarian relief, on Tuesday, hours after   to a ceasefire deal. This followed an overnight assault on the area using warplanes which killed at least 12 civilians. After Israel’s relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip since the start of the war on  , more than one million internally displaced Palestinians have taken shelter in Rafah – many of them previously displaced from other parts of Gaza following Israel’s orders to evacuate from those areas. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed over the course of the war, most of them women and children. Thousands more are missing, feared dead under the rubble.

Politics,"United States President Joe Biden has faced   to stop sending weapons to Israel as the US ally wages war in the Gaza Strip. Rights advocates, lawmakers and protesters across the US have demanded an end to the transfers, warning the president that the arms were being used in human rights violations and war crimes in Gaza. This week, senior   that Washington had paused one shipment of “high payload munitions” to Israel over concerns about the Israeli military’s planned offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Biden himself appeared to go a step further on Wednesday evening, telling CNN that he would not be “supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah” if Israeli forces go into “population centres”. But what exactly did Biden say, what do his remarks mean in practice and what do experts say should come next? 		 		 CNN’s Erin Burnett asked Biden in   about his administration’s decision to pause the single weapons shipment to Israel, which contained 1,800 bombs, each weighing about 900kg (2,000lb), and another 1,700 bombs weighing 226kg (500lb) each. “Have those bombs, those  , been used to kill civilians in Gaza?” Burnett asked. Biden replied: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they [the Israeli forces] go after population centres.” “And I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone into Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, that deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.” The US president added that his administration would “continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of [its] Iron Dome”   as well as in its ability to “respond to attacks”. “But it’s just wrong. We’re not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells,” he said. Burnett then asked Biden whether Israeli forces, which this week seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and launched deadly attacks on the city, had not already “gone into Rafah”. “They haven’t gone into the population centres. What they did is right on the border,” Biden said. “I’ve made it clear to ‘Bibi’ [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] and the war cabinet: They’re not going to get our support if in fact they go into these population centres.” The Rafah border crossing is, however, contiguous with the town of Rafah, and Palestinians point out that even before Israel seized the area, it had been hitting Rafah with air attacks throughout the war, killing numerous civilians, including children. 		 		 Brian Finucane, a senior adviser in the US programme at the International Crisis Group, said Biden was not explicit about the types of weapons that would fall into what he described as those “used historically to deal with Rafah”. The US president’s remarks also were not “a model of clarity as to what the trigger would be for such a termination, given the fact that  “, Finucane told Al Jazeera. He added that “even if there were an immediate cut-off of air-delivered munitions or artillery shells” to the Israeli military, “that may not have an immediate operational impact based on the stores they may have on hand.” Still, Finucane said, “This is another step … and it’s an overdue step, but I think it remains to be seen how the Biden administration will carry through on this.” Patrick Bury, a professor at the University of Bath specialising in warfare, said a wide-scale military operation in Rafah would lead Israel to burn through its munitions very quickly, however. As a result, a potential US weapons cut-off “is going to be a major consideration” for Israel, Bury told Al Jazeera in a television interview. Speaking on Thursday, Netanyahu responded to Biden, saying Israel would “stand alone” if it had to. “I have said that if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,” the prime minister said in a video address. “But we have much more than fingernails, and with that same strength of spirit, with God’s help, together we will win.” 		 		 Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a think tank in Washington, DC, said Biden’s announcement in practice is “very limited, very qualified [and] very conditional”. Biden’s reasoning also is flawed, Jarrar told Al Jazeera, in that it is tied to a disagreement between the US and Israeli governments over Israel’s military tactics and   on Rafah. However, Jarrar said the US president’s remarks are a signal that Washington’s “  seems to be coming to an end”. They also are effectively an “admission that Israel is committing very serious crimes using US weapons – and that admission should lead to very serious consequences that are mandated under US law”, Jarrar said. 		 		 Finuncane said it is important “not to lose sight of the larger picture” during discussions on Israel’s military tactics in Rafah. “The US has substantial leverage to bring to bear to try to bring this conflict to an end,” he said, pointing to the weapons and other military assistance the American government provides to Israel. “It should be using that leverage after seven long months of conflict to bring about an end to the fighting, enable the hostage exchange, … enable aid to get into Gaza and hopefully   writ large.” The US sends Israel $3.8bn in military aid annually, and Congress   in additional support for the country. Jarrar also said the Biden administration needs to apply the country’s own laws, such as the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act. The latter includes the so-called  , which prohibits assistance to foreign military units that commit abuses. The Biden administration’s own self-declared policy on conventional arms transfers also prohibits weapons transfers to countries “suspected of committing genocide or other broad violations of human rights, using US weapons”, Jarrar said. The International Court of Justice, the top United Nations court, said in January that there was a   and ordered Israel to prevent any genocidal acts from taking place in the enclave. “There is a lot” that the Biden administration can do, Jarrar added. “There are also moral and legal commitments [that] the administration is breaching with its continued aiding and abetting of Israel.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/what-did-biden-say-about-us-arms-transfers-to-israel-and-what-does-it-mean,Al Jazeera,What did Biden say about US arms transfers to Israel and what does it mean?
Politics,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has   that the United States paused a weapons shipment to Israel, as President Joe Biden’s administration faces growing pressure to condition aid to the top US ally amid the war in Gaza. Testifying before a US congressional subcommittee on Wednesday, Austin said the Biden administration  “one shipment of high payload munitions” amid concerns about the Israeli military’s push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah. “We’ve been very clear … from the very beginning that Israel shouldn’t launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace,” Austin told US lawmakers. “We’ve not made a final determination on how to proceed with that shipment [of weapons],” the Pentagon chief added, noting that the transfer is separate from a supplemental aid package for Israel that was  . “My final comment is that we are absolutely committed to continuing to support Israel in its right to defend itself.” President Biden himself spoke to the prospect of withholding weapons from Israel in an interview that aired on CNN later on Wednesday, denouncing the prospect of a major offensive in Rafah. “It’s just wrong,” he told CNN. “We’re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.” He clarified that the US would not be “walking away from Israel’s security”, but would rather be stepping away from supporting “Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas”. He cited the use of US weapons against civilians as a reason for the pause. “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres,” Biden said. 		 		   Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, responded to the shipment pause by saying the US decision was “very disappointing”. “[US President Joe Biden] can’t say he is our partner in the goal to destroy Hamas, while on the other hand delay the means meant to destroy Hamas,” Erdan said. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from the White House on Wednesday, said the shipment included 1,800 bombs, each weighing about 900kg (2,000lbs), and another 1,700 bombs – each weighing 226kg (500lbs). “There has been, leading up to this delay, significant concerns on the part of not only   across the United States but also within the president’s own party … about how these weapons are being used,” Halkett said. US Senator Bernie Sanders welcomed the Biden administration’s pause on the weapons transfer, but said it “must be a first step”. “The US must now use all its leverage to demand an immediate ceasefire, the end of the attacks on Rafah, and the immediate delivery of massive amounts of humanitarian aid to people living in desperation,” Sanders said in a statement. “Our leverage is clear. Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.” The Biden administration has faced months of criticism over   amid the Gaza war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians and plunged the enclave into a dire humanitarian crisis. But Washington has largely continued to provide military and diplomatic backing to Israel as the war grinds on. Israel stepped up its bombardment of Rafah on Monday, killing dozens of people after ordering about 100,000 residents in the city’s eastern areas to evacuate. Israeli troops also stormed the Palestinian side of the   between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, which serves as a major gateway for humanitarian aid. Yet despite continuing to say it has concerns for the fate of the more than 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah, the US Department of State this week sought to play down the recent moves by the Israeli army. “This military operation that they launched last night was targeted just to [the] Rafah gate,” US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Tuesday. “It wasn’t an operation in the civilian areas that they had ordered to be evacuated.” Commenting on the paused US weapons shipment to Israel during a news briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Miller stressed that Washington remains “committed to Israel’s security” despite its opposition to a Rafah operation. “We have paused one shipment of near-term assistance and we are reviewing others, but that said, our long-term commitment to Israel’s security has not changed,” he said. Still, human rights advocates have urged the US to do more to pressure the country to end its war on Gaza, and President Biden   — including on US college campuses — over his stance. A new poll released on Wednesday also suggested a growing disconnect between Biden and his Democratic Party base, which could pose a challenge as he   in November. The poll by Data for Progress, in collaboration with news website Zeteo,   that 56 percent of Democrats believed Israel was committing “genocide” in the besieged Palestinian territory. It also found that seven in 10 American voters — and 83 percent of Democrats — also support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. 		 		 Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairman for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party,   that many young people have signalled they will not vote for Biden in the upcoming election. “It’s not just good policy to oppose the genocide; it’s good politics,” he said. The United Nations defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”, including killings and measures to prevent births. In January, the International Court of Justice — the UN’s top court — acknowledged there was a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and ordered Israel to take “all measures within its power” to prevent genocidal acts against Palestinians. Israel has   that it is committing genocide.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/8/pentagon-chief-confirms-us-pause-on-weapons-shipment-to-israel,Al Jazeera,Pentagon chief confirms US pause on weapons shipment to Israel
