The Celtics captured two of the three meetings in the regular season. “We can be better,” Mitchell said after the game. “I hate to be that guy. This was a great win, great series, great test for us mentally and physically. But we can – and will have to be – better to beat Boston. No disrespect to Orlando because they are a phenomenal team with a lot of great guys. I feel that this is big for us as a group, but we really don’t have time to celebrate.” The Cavaliers won despite playing without All-Star centre Jarrett Allen for the third straight game. Orlando’s Paolo Banchero collected 38 points and 16 rebounds while playing in his first career Game 7. “They went on a heck of a run,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said of the Cavs. “I think they did a great job of forcing tough shots. Those tough shots and long shots led to runouts. We got stagnant a little bit [but] we found something that worked. Then we missed a couple [of] shots and they were able to get out and run.

Naz Reid scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, Mike Conley had 14 points and 10 assists and Rudy Gobert grabbed 13 rebounds for Minnesota, which pulled away to begin the postseason 5-0. “They are defending champs, they’re a hard team to beat.

Conley hit his third 3-pointer of the game to give Minnesota an 80-77 lead, but Murray answered from deep and was fouled by Towns. He then proceeded to complete the four-point play. Edwards, who had 25 points in the first half, hit a driving layup through traffic and a pullup 18-footer to put the Timberwolves back in front. Reid hit a pair of 3-pointers, converted a layup and dunked an Edwards miss to give Minnesota a 94-88 lead with 4:20 left.

Towns and Conley had 11 points apiece in the third quarter to help put Minnesota ahead 73-71 going into the fourth. “An 18-4 start, so we get down early, fight like hell to take the lead at halftime, then we played no defense in the third,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. “You can’t just trade baskets with that team.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/5/nba-western-conference-semis-minnesota-stun-nba-champs-denver-in-game-1,Al Jazeera,Minnesota stun NBA champs Denver in Game 1 of Western Conference semis
Sports,"The top-seeded Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder have rolled to convincing victories in their opening NBA playoff series. Eastern Conference top seeds Boston laid down a marker with a 120-95 rout of the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers at the TD Garden on Tuesday. Oklahoma City, meanwhile, were made to work harder by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks before finally pulling clear to seal a 117-95 victory in their Western Conference semifinal series opener. In Boston, Jaylen Brown scored 32 points while Derrick White added 25, including seven three-pointers, in an emphatic win for the Celtics, who are chasing a record 18th NBA championship. Boston were in complete control for most of the game, holding a double-digit lead through the second half to close out an emphatic win at the TD Garden. Boston star Jayson Tatum added 18 points but had an off-night shooting-wise, making just 7-of-19 from the field. Donovan Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 33 points, with Evan Mobley adding 17 and Darius Garland 14. Brown said the Celtics’ defence had laid the foundation for the win. “It starts with defence, we wanted to set the tone on defence and we kept them under 100 (points),” Brown told TNT television. “But we feel like we’ve got an answer for everything so we just play the game the right way, and see what they want to take away and then we play after that.” Game two in the series takes place in Boston on Thursday. 🏆 TUESDAY'S FINAL SCORES 🏆 Jaylen Brown comes out in attack mode, scoring 15 in the 1st, on way to 32 for the game as the   take Game 1!

Trailing by nine points at half-time, Dallas rallied in the third quarter to get within one point at 66-65. But the youthful Thunder lineup began to find their range, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander adding 10 points in the third quarter to help OKC build a 10-point cushion heading into the fourth quarter. Oklahoma City’s barrage of scoring continued in the fourth with Jalen Williams adding 10 points as the Thunder outscored their visitors 28-16 to seal victory by a 22-point margin. Gilgeous-Alexander led the OKC scoring, finishing with 29 points, nine rebounds and nine assists while Chet Holmgren added 19 points and Williams 18. Kyrie Irving led Dallas with 20 points while Luka Doncic, struggling with a sore knee, finished with 19 after shooting six-of-19 from the field. Oklahoma City, who have an average age of just over 23, are the youngest team to win a second-round playoff game and were the youngest team to win a postseason series after sweeping the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round. “We don’t worry about all the statistics and the stats, and how young we are,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after the win. “We just want to win basketball games at a high level and that’s what we focus on. “We try to get that done every night and tonight we did so.” Doncic said the Mavericks would need to improve dramatically for Game Two taking place in Oklahoma City on Thursday. The Slovenian star brushed off questions about his own shooting performance. “Who cares? We lost. We’ve just got to move on to the next one. I’ve got to be better, we’ve got to be better,” Doncic said. “They’re a great defensive team and a great offensive team, so it’s not going to be easy at all.

Sports,"Malaysia’s Football Association has recommended players consider hiring bodyguards while top club Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) has beefed up security for its squad after their midfielder Safiq Rahim became the third footballer to be attacked in the country in the past week. Former Malaysia captain Safiq Rahim was threatened with a hammer and had his car windscreen smashed by two assailants late on Tuesday. Safiq was not injured in the attack late in southern Johor state following a training session with JohorDarul Ta’zim, the local league’s defending champion and one of Asia’s top clubs which is run by the crown prince of the Johor royal family. The 36-year-old midfielder posted a photo of his black Honda with its rear windscreen smashed on Instagram. “Didn’t expect to be attacked near the Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) training centre. We need to be vigilant,” he wrote in the post. He also shared a copy of the police report he made on Instagram where he said: “Two men on a motorcycle suddenly approached my car armed with a hammer and smashed my rear car windscreen.” “I stopped the car and I was in fear.” The incident comes within a week of two other attacks on footballers in the Southeast Asian nation. It has led Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) president Hamidin Mohamad Amin to urge high-profile footballers to take precautions about their personal safety, including hiring bodyguards. “If you are a big player, you can consider what the overseas footballers are doing, which is to get a bodyguard,” he was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper. Malaysia’s right winger Faisal Halim is in an intensive care unit with fourth-degree burns after being splashed with acid at the weekend outside the capital Kuala Lumpur. Police are investigating the motive for the attack. Nicknamed “Mickey”, the 26-year-old plays on the right wing for Selangor Football Club and Malaysia. Faisal suffered burns on the neck, shoulder, hands and chest in Petaling Jaya district over the weekend. “I am at the hospital. Faisal’s condition is a bit critical but stable,” Football Association of Selangor deputy president Shahril Mokhtar told AFP news agency. He said Faisal was initially diagnosed as having suffered second-degree burns, “but after he was moved to another hospital, a plastic surgeon classified the injuries as fourth-degree burns.” Shahril said Faisal would undergo another surgery, adding that his movement and speech had been affected. “We are shocked and disappointed that such an attack happened in Malaysia. My concern is also about the mental health of the other players since the new season begins on Friday,” he said. CEO of Selangor Football Club Johan Kamal Hamidon said security has been heightened for the players, officials and staff of the club but he did not elaborate. A photo that went viral online showed a visibly shocked and shirtless Faisal seated on a bench with burn marks on his upper body. The acid attack came three days after another national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was injured in a robbery outside his home in the eastern state of Terengganu. Kuala Terengganu police chief Azli Mohamad Noor said the incidents were unrelated. The Malaysian FA urged fans to “stand with Halim” in a post on social media last week. “Together, we all continue to pray that Harimau Malaya player, Faisal Halim will be granted well-being and recovery for him to recover as usual. Our hero, Faisal Halim.” 𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐖𝐈𝐓𝐇 𝐅𝐀𝐈𝐒𝐀𝐋 𝐇𝐀𝐋𝐈𝐌 Sama-sama kita semua terus mendoakan agar pemain Harimau Malaya, Faisal Halim diberikan kesejahteraan dan kesembuhan untuk beliau pulih seperti sediakala.

Sports,"Real Madrid earned what coach Carlo Ancelotti said was a “deserved” La Liga title after beating Cadiz 3-0 and Girona sealed it with a stunning 4-2 victory over Barcelona. Ancelotti’s side did their homework by beating Cadiz and after last season’s champions stumbled against Girona, Los Blancos were crowned champions for a record-extending 36th time on Saturday. Girona’s dramatic victory saw the Catalan minnows qualify for the Champions League for the first time in their history, in only their fourth season in Spain’s top flight. Ancelotti rotated heavily ahead of the Champions League semifinal second-leg clash with Bayern Munich next week, but his players still got the job done. Brahim Diaz netted in the 51st minute to put Madrid ahead and then set up Jude Bellingham, with Joselu tapping home a third. 🙌 WE ARE THE LALIGA 2023/24 CHAMPIONS! 🙌  — Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden)  “We’ve had a spectacular Liga campaign,” Ancelotti told reporters. “We’ve made few errors and the advantage is deserved.” Madrid’s comfortable win over Cadiz sent them 14 points clear of last season’s champions Barcelona, in third, with only 12 left to play for. Girona, second after their second 4-2 win over Barcelona this season, trail Madrid by 13 points. “We leave our skins out there on the pitch to live moments like today’s,” Madrid striker Joselu told Real Madrid TV. “There are young players who are very hungry for titles, veterans who are delighted to be here… and these are special moments.” 🏆🤍   are crowned CHAMPIONS of   with 4 Matchdays to play!  — LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN)  Los Blancos were able to celebrate after Girona came from behind twice to defeat Barcelona in a wild clash, moving second. Barca took the lead through Andreas Christensen’s fine volley after three minutes but La Liga’s top scorer Artem Dovbyk levelled with his 20th goal of the campaign just a minute later. Robert Lewandowski sent Barcelona ahead with a penalty after Lamine Yamal was felled, but substitute Portu made a huge impact in the second half for Girona. Michel Sanchez’s side netted two goals in two minutes to turn the game on its head. Portu netted the equaliser moments after coming on and then set up Miguel Gutierrez to put Girona ahead. Portu sensationally volleyed home the fourth to ignite Girona’s tiny Montilivi stadium and get the party started. “The players have entered Girona’s history books, what we’ve done this year is incredible,” said Sanchez. Girona played Champions League music over the stadium sound system to give their fans a taste of things to come. “I want to play against Liverpool, I want a historic giant here, there are many, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Inter.” “It’s incredible to look at your shirt and experience this. There is nothing more beautiful than living this,” an emotional Portu told DAZN with tears rolling down his face. “I had a thorn in my side with this club. A few years ago, I experienced the other side, which was relegation and I felt very responsible because I played a lot. Today I made amends with the fans and I can smile again.” For Barcelona, third, the summer will be for self-reflection rather than dreams. “It’s a shame, we sink with any negative situation,” said Barcelona coach Xavi after Barcelona lost their crown. “Like this it’s impossible to compete.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/5/la-liga-title-for-real-madrid-champions-league-for-girona-as-barca-lose,Al Jazeera,"La Liga title for Real Madrid, Champions League for Girona as Barca lose"
Sports,"Japan’s undisputed super bantamweight world champion, Naoya Inoue, has survived an early scare to stop Mexico’s Luis Nery in the sixth round at the Tokyo Dome and defend his titles. Fans at the famous venue, which seats more than 45,000 people, were stunned on Monday when Nery floored the unbeaten “Monster” in the first round with a huge left. But Inoue got up and knocked his Mexican opponent down in the following round and sent him to the canvas again in the fifth before finishing him off with a right hook in the sixth. “It was a great feeling to knock him down, but how about that surprise in the first round?” the 31-year-old Inoue asked. “As a boxer, when that happens to you, it fires you up. It gave me a lot of energy.” It was the first boxing event to be held at the Tokyo Dome since 42-1 underdog James “Buster” Douglas knocked out unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in February 1990 in one of the sport’s biggest upsets. “There was a lot of pressure on me as the main event in the first boxing at Tokyo Dome in 34 years, but it gave me strength,” Inoue said. Inoue took his record to 27-0 with 24 wins by knockout. It was his first fight since becoming the undisputed super bantamweight world champion in December. He is just the second man to become undisputed world champion at two different weights since the four-belt era began in 2004. American Terence Crawford was the first. Fans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs. A huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling. But it seemed to energise Inoue, and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round. Inoue continued to land ferocious blows, and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round. The referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.   Nery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there. He was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan, but the country’s Boxing Commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue. Nery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd. The 29-year-old’s record fell to 35-2 with 27 KOs. Inoue was fighting at super bantamweight for only the third time after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles. He moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama’s Enrique Pinder in 1972. Earlier, fighting on the undercard, Japan’s Yoshiki Takei beat Australian defending champion Jason Moloney by unanimous decision to win the WBO bantamweight world title. Takei started strongly before Moloney came back into the bout in his second title defence. But the Japanese fighter, a former kickboxer who had won all eight of his previous boxing matches by knockout, took the title in front of a raucous crowd .",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/6/inoue-vs-nery-japanese-champ-defends-super-bantamweight-titles-in-tokyo,Al Jazeera,Inoue stops Nery to remain undisputed super bantamweight champ

Sports,"Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday. New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden. Indiana exploited Brunson’s absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup. But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter. The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory. Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece. Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points. Jalen Brunson lights it up in Game 2, scoring 24 of his 29 PTS in the 2nd half propelling the   to the 2-0 series lead! Game 3 is Friday at 7pm/et on ESPN. OG Anunoby: 28 PTS (playoff career high), 4 3PM Josh Hart: 19 PTS, 15 REB, 7 AST Donte DiVincenzo: 28 PTS & 6 3PM…  — NBA (@NBA)  “We found a way, that’s it,” said an exhausted Brunson. “For us it starts with our habits — we’ve talked about doing the little things from day one a little bit better, because you never know when they’re going to help you in a big game. “It’s all about doing the little things well every single day, and we pride ourselves on that.” The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic. As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem. Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth-quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm’s length. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed the team were uncertain of whether Brunson would continue after missing the second quarter. “We didn’t know if he was going to be able to go or not, but he found a way to get it done,” Thibodeau said. Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana’s scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks’ Hartenstein. Carlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated. “I’m always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,” Carlisle said. “There’s not a consistent balance and that’s disappointing. Give New York credit for the physicality that they’re playing with. But their physicality is rewarded and ours is penalized.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/9/nba-playoffs-brunson-guides-ny-knicks-win-over-indiana-pacers,Al Jazeera,Brunson shines as NY Knicks fight back to beat Indiana Pacers in Game 2

Sports,"McLaren’s Lando Norris has won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix. Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by more than seven seconds, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finishing third. Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings. It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris’s McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri took the lead. Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back. Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished. The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall and bringing a yellow flag. Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory. It was the first time Verstappen had been beaten on track when he finished the race since Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year. Your top ten in the 2024 Miami Grand Prix! 🌴     — Formula 1 (@F1)  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end. “About time huh?” said Norris, “I knew on Friday that we had the pace … today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy. It all paid off,” he added. “I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I’ve made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team. “I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,” he added. Pulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome. LANDO NORRIS IS A FORMULA 1 RACE WINNER! LANDO WINS THE  !!! 🧡  — McLaren (@McLarenF1)  The nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in the rain, costing him dearly. Verstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday’s race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres. “They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I’ll take it right? “I’m very happy for Lando, it’s been a long time coming and it’s not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,” said the Dutchman. Very happy for  , congrats mate! 👏 For us it was not our strongest race, but I'll take P2 today.    — Max Verstappen (@Max33Verstappen)  Leclerc echoed those sentiments. “Very often he ran very close to it, but for one reason or another, he didn’t make it. But today he did an incredible job, and the whole weekend he has been on it,” said the Ferrari driver. As in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities. Former France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race. Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm. “He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,” said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. Norris’s parents were ecstatic, though they weren’t in Miami to witness the moment. “The cider’s flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,” Adam Norris told Sky Sports. “I was working out it’s probably about 900 races I’ve been to over the last 16 years. “It’s brilliant. So happy for him.” Anthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son – seven times world champion Lewis – also texted Norris congratulations. Norris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win. “This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,” said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. You never forget your first!

Sports,"Tunisia’s Olympic 400-metre freestyle champion Ahmed Hafnaoui is unlikely to defend his title at this year’s Games in Paris due to an injury. The 21-year-old’s participation at the Paris Olympics was cast in doubt after Mehrez Bousyan, head of the Tunisian Olympic Committee, told a locally televised sports programme that Hafnaoui will miss “a significant portion” of the Games, according to Africa Aquatics. However, the swimmer has refused to rule himself out completely. “I’m currently suffering from an injury, and I don’t know whether or not I will participate in the Olympics,” the 21-year-old Tunisian swimmer told AFP news agency on Wednesday. He did not give details of the injury. Boussayene said “nothing is confirmed”, adding the swimmer had a “developing injury” in his comments to AFP. “More than just medals, we seek above all the wellbeing of this young man who brought us so much joy,” said Boussayene. “He will have other world competitions.” Hafnaoui’s   sent a wave of wild celebrations through the North African nation. The then 18-year-old finished in three minutes, 43.26 seconds despite being the slowest qualifier to start the final.

Sports,"Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick and Lionel Messi had an incredible five assists and a goal in the second half as a rampant Inter Miami crushed the New York Red Bulls 6-2 in Major League Soccer. Two-goal substitute Matias Rojas sparked the second-half rout from Eastern Conference leaders Inter after New York had led 1-0 at the break. Without Messi, Miami had fallen to a 4-0 defeat to the Red Bulls in New York in March, but they more than avenged that loss with a merciless second-half demolition job on Saturday. Messi’s five assists, which all came in the second half, are a new record for an MLS game and he now has 10 goals and 12 assists in eight league appearances so far this season. Operating behind Suarez, Messi’s passing through the slightest of gaps, taking advantage of his former Barcelona teammate’s telepathic understanding of his intentions, was simply too much for the Red Bulls, who came into the game third in the East. “Obviously what we have seen today surprises people, because you don’t see that in football,” said Suarez of Messi’s five assists. “But as a teammate and someone who knows him, nothing surprises me about him,” added the Uruguayan. The 37-year-old Suarez’s triples take his own tally to 10 in 11 league games for Miami and despite no longer being blessed with pace, his deadly finishing clearly remains intact. While it was the kind of attacking display that Miami owners Jorge Mas and David Beckham surely dreamed of when they brought in the star pairing, there was no sign of the explosiveness in the opening half. Dante Vanzeir had put the Red Bulls ahead in the 30th minute, slotting home after Wikelman Carmona’s shot came out off the post, following a superb through pass from Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg. Gerardo Martino’s Inter lacked intensity and ideas in the opening 45 minutes but the coach’s half-time change transformed the game. Paraguayan Rojas was introduced for the second half and took just three minutes to make an impact, collecting a pass from Messi and evading two defenders before unleashing an unstoppable drive from 25 yards out. Messi then put Miami in front when Rojas robbed Carmona and found Suarez, who slipped the ball to the Argentinian, who made no mistake. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner then turned provider again as he split the New York defence with a brilliant through ball to Rojas, who deftly chipped over the advancing Carlos Coronel. Suarez’s hat-trick then came in the space of 12 minutes – he first found the target when Messi chipped in a ball from the right and the Uruguayan hooked home a volley. It was playground stuff minutes later when Suarez played a one-two with Messi and then poked home to make it 5-1. Messi was yet again the creator for Miami’s sixth, which Suarez turned in from close range from the tightest of angles. “The partnership of him [Messi] and Luis [Suarez] in the second half worked very well, like in old times … They were very influential in the game,” said Martino. New York had a late consolation in the final seconds with a penalty from Forsberg.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/5/messi-and-saurez-lead-inter-miamis-6-2-mls-win-over-new-york-red-bulls,Al Jazeera,‘Like old times’: Messi and Suarez shine in Inter Miami’s 6-2 win
