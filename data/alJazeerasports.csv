Sports,"Malaysia‚Äôs Football Association has recommended players consider hiring bodyguards while top club Johor Darul Ta‚Äôzim (JDT) has beefed up security for its squad after their midfielder Safiq Rahim became the third footballer to be attacked in the country in the past week. Former Malaysia captain Safiq Rahim was threatened with a hammer and had his car windscreen smashed by two assailants late on Tuesday. Safiq was not injured in the attack late in southern Johor state following a training session with JohorDarul Ta‚Äôzim, the local league‚Äôs defending champion and one of Asia‚Äôs top clubs which is run by the crown prince of the Johor royal family. The 36-year-old midfielder posted a photo of his black Honda with its rear windscreen smashed on Instagram. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect to be attacked near the Johor Darul Ta‚Äôzim (JDT) training centre. We need to be vigilant,‚Äù he wrote in the post. He also shared a copy of the police report he made on Instagram where he said: ‚ÄúTwo men on a motorcycle suddenly approached my car armed with a hammer and smashed my rear car windscreen.‚Äù ‚ÄúI stopped the car and I was in fear.‚Äù The incident comes within a week of two other attacks on footballers in the Southeast Asian nation. It has led Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) president Hamidin Mohamad Amin to urge high-profile footballers to take precautions about their personal safety, including hiring bodyguards. ‚ÄúIf you are a big player, you can consider what the overseas footballers are doing, which is to get a bodyguard,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper. Malaysia‚Äôs right winger Faisal Halim is in an intensive care unit with fourth-degree burns after being splashed with acid at the weekend outside the capital Kuala Lumpur. Police are investigating the motive for the attack. Nicknamed ‚ÄúMickey‚Äù, the 26-year-old plays on the right wing for Selangor Football Club and Malaysia. Faisal suffered burns on the neck, shoulder, hands and chest in Petaling Jaya district over the weekend. ‚ÄúI am at the hospital. Faisal‚Äôs condition is a bit critical but stable,‚Äù Football Association of Selangor deputy president Shahril Mokhtar told AFP news agency. He said Faisal was initially diagnosed as having suffered second-degree burns, ‚Äúbut after he was moved to another hospital, a plastic surgeon classified the injuries as fourth-degree burns.‚Äù Shahril said Faisal would undergo another surgery, adding that his movement and speech had been affected. ‚ÄúWe are shocked and disappointed that such an attack happened in Malaysia. My concern is also about the mental health of the other players since the new season begins on Friday,‚Äù he said. CEO of Selangor Football Club Johan Kamal Hamidon said security has been heightened for the players, officials and staff of the club but he did not elaborate. A photo that went viral online showed a visibly shocked and shirtless Faisal seated on a bench with burn marks on his upper body. The acid attack came three days after another national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was injured in a robbery outside his home in the eastern state of Terengganu. Kuala Terengganu police chief Azli Mohamad Noor said the incidents were unrelated. The Malaysian FA urged fans to ‚Äústand with Halim‚Äù in a post on social media last week. ‚ÄúTogether, we all continue to pray that Harimau Malaya player, Faisal Halim will be granted well-being and recovery for him to recover as usual.

Girona‚Äôs dramatic victory saw the Catalan minnows qualify for the Champions League for the first time in their history, in only their fourth season in Spain‚Äôs top flight. Ancelotti rotated heavily ahead of the Champions League semifinal second-leg clash with Bayern Munich next week, but his players still got the job done.

Sports,"Japan‚Äôs undisputed super bantamweight world champion, Naoya Inoue, has survived an early scare to stop Mexico‚Äôs Luis Nery in the sixth round at the Tokyo Dome and defend his titles. Fans at the famous venue, which seats more than 45,000 people, were stunned on Monday when Nery floored the unbeaten ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù in the first round with a huge left. But Inoue got up and knocked his Mexican opponent down in the following round and sent him to the canvas again in the fifth before finishing him off with a right hook in the sixth. ‚ÄúIt was a great feeling to knock him down, but how about that surprise in the first round?‚Äù the 31-year-old Inoue asked. ‚ÄúAs a boxer, when that happens to you, it fires you up. It gave me a lot of energy.‚Äù It was the first boxing event to be held at the Tokyo Dome since 42-1 underdog James ‚ÄúBuster‚Äù Douglas knocked out unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in February 1990 in one of the sport‚Äôs biggest upsets. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of pressure on me as the main event in the first boxing at Tokyo Dome in 34 years, but it gave me strength,‚Äù Inoue said. Inoue took his record to 27-0 with 24 wins by knockout. It was his first fight since becoming the undisputed super bantamweight world champion in December. He is just the second man to become undisputed world champion at two different weights since the four-belt era began in 2004. American Terence Crawford was the first. Fans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs. A huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling. But it seemed to energise Inoue, and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round. Inoue continued to land ferocious blows, and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round. The referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round. ¬† Nery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there. He was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan, but the country‚Äôs Boxing Commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue. Nery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd. The 29-year-old‚Äôs record fell to 35-2 with 27 KOs. Inoue was fighting at super bantamweight for only the third time after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles. He moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama‚Äôs Enrique Pinder in 1972. Earlier, fighting on the undercard, Japan‚Äôs Yoshiki Takei beat Australian defending champion Jason Moloney by unanimous decision to win the WBO bantamweight world title. Takei started strongly before Moloney came back into the bout in his second title defence.

Sports,"Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday. New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden. Indiana exploited Brunson‚Äôs absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup. But a limping Brunson ‚Äì who returned at the start of the third quarter ‚Äì led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter. The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory. Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece. Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.

As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem. Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth-quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm‚Äôs length. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed the team were uncertain of whether Brunson would continue after missing the second quarter. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know if he was going to be able to go or not, but he found a way to get it done,‚Äù Thibodeau said. Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana‚Äôs scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks‚Äô Hartenstein. Carlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,‚Äù Carlisle said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a consistent balance and that‚Äôs disappointing.

Sports,"McLaren‚Äôs Lando Norris has won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix. Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by more than seven seconds, with Ferrari‚Äôs Charles Leclerc finishing third. Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings. It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris‚Äôs McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri took the lead. Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back. Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished. The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall and bringing a yellow flag. Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory. It was the first time Verstappen had been beaten on track when he finished the race since Ferrari‚Äôs Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year. Your top ten in the 2024 Miami Grand Prix! üå¥     ‚Äî Formula 1 (@F1)  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end. ‚ÄúAbout time huh?‚Äù said Norris, ‚ÄúI knew on Friday that we had the pace ‚Ä¶ today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy. It all paid off,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team. ‚ÄúI stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,‚Äù he added.

LANDO NORRIS IS A FORMULA 1 RACE WINNER! LANDO WINS THE  !!! üß°  ‚Äî McLaren (@McLarenF1)  The nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in the rain, costing him dearly. Verstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday‚Äôs race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres. ‚ÄúThey just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I‚Äôll take it right? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy for Lando, it‚Äôs been a long time coming and it‚Äôs not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,‚Äù said the Dutchman. Very happy for  , congrats mate! üëè For us it was not our strongest race, but I'll take P2 today.    ‚Äî Max Verstappen (@Max33Verstappen)  Leclerc echoed those sentiments. ‚ÄúVery often he ran very close to it, but for one reason or another, he didn‚Äôt make it. But today he did an incredible job, and the whole weekend he has been on it,‚Äù said the Ferrari driver. As in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL‚Äôs Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities. Former France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race. Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm. ‚ÄúHe saw me after and he came to congratulate me,‚Äù said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. Norris‚Äôs parents were ecstatic, though they weren‚Äôt in Miami to witness the moment. ‚ÄúThe cider‚Äôs flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,‚Äù Adam Norris told Sky Sports. ‚ÄúI was working out it‚Äôs probably about 900 races I‚Äôve been to over the last 16 years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant.

Sports,"Tunisia‚Äôs Olympic 400-metre freestyle champion Ahmed Hafnaoui is unlikely to defend his title at this year‚Äôs Games in Paris due to an injury. The 21-year-old‚Äôs participation at the Paris Olympics was cast in doubt after Mehrez Bousyan, head of the Tunisian Olympic Committee, told a locally televised sports programme that Hafnaoui will miss ‚Äúa significant portion‚Äù of the Games, according to Africa Aquatics. However, the swimmer has refused to rule himself out completely. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently suffering from an injury, and I don‚Äôt know whether or not I will participate in the Olympics,‚Äù the 21-year-old Tunisian swimmer told AFP news agency on Wednesday. He did not give details of the injury. Boussayene said ‚Äúnothing is confirmed‚Äù, adding the swimmer had a ‚Äúdeveloping injury‚Äù in his comments to AFP. ‚ÄúMore than just medals, we seek above all the wellbeing of this young man who brought us so much joy,‚Äù said Boussayene. ‚ÄúHe will have other world competitions.‚Äù Hafnaoui‚Äôs   sent a wave of wild celebrations through the North African nation. The then 18-year-old finished in three minutes, 43.26 seconds despite being the slowest qualifier to start the final. Hafnaoui went on to win the 800-metre and 1,500-metre freestyle titles at last year‚Äôs World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. If he swims in Paris this year, he has a chance to match Tunisia‚Äôs top Olympic swimmer Oussama Mellouli, who won two golds and a bronze in the 2008 and 2012 Games. The country‚Äôs top Olympic medallist is long-distance runner Mohammed Gammoudi, winner of four medals, including one gold in the 5,000-metre in 1968, between 1964 and 1972.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/8/tunisias-olympic-swimming-champion-ahmed-hafnaoui-to-miss-paris-2024,Al Jazeera,Tunisia‚Äôs Olympic swimming champ Ahmed Hafnaoui likely to miss Paris 2024
Sports,"Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick and Lionel Messi had an incredible five assists and a goal in the second half as a rampant Inter Miami crushed the New York Red Bulls 6-2 in Major League Soccer. Two-goal substitute Matias Rojas sparked the second-half rout from Eastern Conference leaders Inter after New York had led 1-0 at the break. Without Messi, Miami had fallen to a 4-0 defeat to the Red Bulls in New York in March, but they more than avenged that loss with a merciless second-half demolition job on Saturday. Messi‚Äôs five assists, which all came in the second half, are a new record for an MLS game and he now has 10 goals and 12 assists in eight league appearances so far this season. Operating behind Suarez, Messi‚Äôs passing through the slightest of gaps, taking advantage of his former Barcelona teammate‚Äôs telepathic understanding of his intentions, was simply too much for the Red Bulls, who came into the game third in the East. ‚ÄúObviously what we have seen today surprises people, because you don‚Äôt see that in football,‚Äù said Suarez of Messi‚Äôs five assists. ‚ÄúBut as a teammate and someone who knows him, nothing surprises me about him,‚Äù added the Uruguayan. The 37-year-old Suarez‚Äôs triples take his own tally to 10 in 11 league games for Miami and despite no longer being blessed with pace, his deadly finishing clearly remains intact. While it was the kind of attacking display that Miami owners Jorge Mas and David Beckham surely dreamed of when they brought in the star pairing, there was no sign of the explosiveness in the opening half. Dante Vanzeir had put the Red Bulls ahead in the 30th minute, slotting home after Wikelman Carmona‚Äôs shot came out off the post, following a superb through pass from Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg. Gerardo Martino‚Äôs Inter lacked intensity and ideas in the opening 45 minutes but the coach‚Äôs half-time change transformed the game. Paraguayan Rojas was introduced for the second half and took just three minutes to make an impact, collecting a pass from Messi and evading two defenders before unleashing an unstoppable drive from 25 yards out. Messi then put Miami in front when Rojas robbed Carmona and found Suarez, who slipped the ball to the Argentinian, who made no mistake. The eight-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner then turned provider again as he split the New York defence with a brilliant through ball to Rojas, who deftly chipped over the advancing Carlos Coronel. Suarez‚Äôs hat-trick then came in the space of 12 minutes ‚Äì he first found the target when Messi chipped in a ball from the right and the Uruguayan hooked home a volley. It was playground stuff minutes later when Suarez played a one-two with Messi and then poked home to make it 5-1. Messi was yet again the creator for Miami‚Äôs sixth, which Suarez turned in from close range from the tightest of angles. ‚ÄúThe partnership of him [Messi] and Luis [Suarez] in the second half worked very well, like in old times ‚Ä¶ They were very influential in the game,‚Äù said Martino. New York had a late consolation in the final seconds with a penalty from Forsberg.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/5/messi-and-saurez-lead-inter-miamis-6-2-mls-win-over-new-york-red-bulls,Al Jazeera,‚ÄòLike old times‚Äô: Messi and Suarez shine in Inter Miami‚Äôs 6-2 win
