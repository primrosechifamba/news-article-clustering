Large-scale protests on university grounds have spilled over to at least 90 campuses around the world. Click on the points on the map below to see more details. Al Jazeera will update the map as more information becomes available. More than 1,600 students and faculty members have been arrested in the US over the past two weeks as protesters continue to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and divestment from companies enabling Israel’s nearly seven-month war on Gaza. The protests have grown violent as law enforcement agencies have tried to remove students and faculty from encampments and protest sites. Students have been suspended, put on probation and, in rare cases, expelled from their colleges. Momodou Taal was among four students from Cornell University in New York state who were “temporarily suspended” on Saturday for setting up an encampment on campus. He told Al Jazeera the protesting students received threats and were subjected to doxxing, the posting of their personal information on the internet without their consent.

Entertainment,"As a new moon was not   on Monday evening after Maghrib prayers, Muslims in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries will fast one more day, completing 30 days of Ramadan. The first day of Eid will then be celebrated on Wednesday, April 10.  al-Fitr, the “festival of breaking the fast”, is celebrated at the end of the fasting month of Ramadan by Muslims worldwide. There are about 1.9 billion Muslims around the world, approximately 25 percent of the world population. Indonesia has the world’s highest Muslim population, with some 240 million Muslims living in the country. Pakistan is second with about 225 million Muslims, followed by India (211 million), Bangladesh (155 million) and Nigeria (111 million). Traditionally,   is celebrated for three days as an official holiday in Muslim-majority countries. However, the number of holiday days varies by country. Muslims begin Eid day celebrations by partaking in a prayer service shortly after dawn, followed by a short sermon. The day is spent visiting relatives and neighbours, accepting sweets, and extending Eid greetings as they move around from house to house. The most popular greeting is “Eid mubarak” (Blessed Eid) or “Eid sa’id” (Happy Eid). Eid greetings also vary depending on the country and language.

Entertainment,"Every year on March 30, Palestinians observe Land Day, or Yom al-Ard, recalling the events of March 30, 1976, when six unarmed Palestinians were killed and more than 100 injured by Israeli forces during protests against Israel’s confiscation of Palestinian land. Israel ordered the confiscation of 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) of land belonging to Palestinian citizens of Israel in the Galilee. These plans were part of Israeli state policy to Judaise Galilee following the creation of the state of Israel. The confiscated land is roughly the size of 3,000 football pitches or the area from the tip of Manhattan to Central Park in New York, US. Palestinians, both inside Israel and across the occupied territory, mark this day by holding protests and vigils and planting olive trees to reaffirm their connection to the land. The protests are often met with brutal use of force by Israel. Yes, Israel has continued to seize large swaths of Palestinian land, designating them as military zones, state land and other labels. Most recently, on March 22, 2024, Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich   (1,977 acres) in the occupied West Bank, in a move that would facilitate building more illegal settlements. “While there are those in Israel and in the world who seek to undermine our right to Judea and Samaria and the country in general, we promote settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country,” Smotrich said, using Biblical names for the area that are commonly heard in Israel. Settlements – illegal under international law – are   in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. On March 6, Israel’s settlement-planning authority announced it had approved the construction of   in Maale Adumim, Kedar and Efrat within the occupied West Bank. From November 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023, Israel has approved at least 24,000 illegal housing units to be built on Palestinian land. Earlier this month, the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said settlements had expanded by a record amount and risked eliminating any possibility of a Palestinian state.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/30/land-day-what-happened-in-palestine-in-1976,Al Jazeera,Land Day: What happened in Palestine in 1976?
Entertainment,"As the sun goes down during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, many Muslims will break their fasts with a sweet, brown, dried fruit that has ancient history in the region. During these  , able-bodied, observant Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual relations during daylight hours to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God. Breaking one’s fast with dates and water is rooted in the religious teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and is specifically mentioned in the Quran for its nutritional value. Dates, fresh or dried, contain important vitamins, minerals and fibre. They are also high in antioxidants. Given their high level of fructose, a natural sugar found in fruit, dates are a great source of energy, especially after a long day’s fast. There are many different varieties of dates, each with different tastes and textures: : known for their large size, sweet taste, amber colour and richness in flavour  less sweet than other kinds of dates with an elongated shape, reddish-brown hue and chewiness  have a soft, fleshy, almost juicy feel, are very sweet and are among the dates most revered by Muslims because they are grown in Medina, Saudi Arabia  medium-sized, lighter in colour and ideal for cooking and baking  darker skin, rich flavour, slightly drier and known for their unique taste Dates have been cultivated for thousands of years. Date palm trees are either male or female, and only the female plant produces fruit. A mature date palm can produce more than 100kg (220lb) of dates per harvest season – about 10,000 dates. The Ajwa date is the most expensive date in the world. In 2022, according to   a food and agriculture database, about 10 billion kilogrammes (22 billion pounds) of dates were produced worldwide. Dates tend to thrive in countries with long, hot summers like those in the Middle East and neighbouring regions. Egypt is the world’s top date producer, producing nearly one in five, or 18 percent, of the world’s dates, according to Tridge. Saudi Arabia follows at nearly 17 percent with Algeria rounding off the top three at 13 percent. The infographic below shows where most of the world’s dates come from: Israel is one of the world’s largest exporters of dates, selling $330m of medjool dates abroad in 2022, according to Tridge. During Israel’s nearly six-month war on Gaza, which has killed more than   people, several groups have called for a boycott of Israel-related products. One such group is the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement ( ), a Palestinian-led initiative that seeks to challenge international support for what it calls Israeli apartheid and settler colonialism. BDS has urged consumers to always check labels and not buy dates that are produced or packaged in Israel or its settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law. They recommend avoiding the following brands:",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/31/ramadan-2024-where-do-your-dates-come-from,Al Jazeera,Ramadan 2024: Where do your dates come from?
Entertainment,"As a new moon was not   on Monday evening after Maghrib prayers, Muslims in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries will fast one more day, completing 30 days of Ramadan. The first day of Eid will then be celebrated on Wednesday, April 10. The first day of Eid al-Fitr is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon marking the start of the month of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic (Hijri) calendar. Lunar months last between 29 and 30 days so Muslims usually have to wait until the night before Eid to verify its date. Other countries follow independent sightings. When the sighting has been verified, Eid is declared on television, radio stations and at mosques. Traditionally, Eid is celebrated for three days as an official holiday in Muslim-majority countries. However, the number of holiday days varies by country. Muslims begin Eid day celebrations by partaking in a prayer service that takes place shortly after dawn, followed by a short sermon. On their way to the prayer, which is traditionally held in an open area, Muslims recite takbeerat, praising God by saying “Allahu Akbar”, meaning “God is great”. It is customary to eat something sweet before the prayer, such as  -filled biscuits known as maamoul in the Middle East. This particular festival is known as the “sweet” Eid – and the distribution of sweets is common across the Muslim world. Muslims usually spend the day visiting relatives and neighbours and accepting sweets as they move around from house to house. Each country has traditional desserts and sweets that are prepared before Eid or on the morning of the first day. Children, dressed in new clothes, are offered gifts and money to celebrate the joyous occasion. Girls and women in many countries decorate their hands with henna. The celebration for Eid begins the night before as women gather in neighbourhoods and large family gatherings for the application of henna. In some countries, families visit graveyards to offer their respects to departed family members right after the morning prayers. It is common for Muslim-majority countries to decorate their cities with lights and hold festivities to commemorate the end of the fasting month. For some 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza this Eid, this will be the first Muslim religious holiday after more than   people have been killed in Israeli attacks. With little   aid, and very limited water, Gaza’s Eid al-Fitr will be mired in destruction amid the continuing attacks. The most popular greeting is “Eid Mubarak” (Blessed Eid) or “Eid sa’id” (Happy Eid). Eid greetings also vary depending on the country and language.

Entertainment,"It has been six months since Israel launched its brutal assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7. Israel shows no sign of stopping, as its allies continue to provide it with more weapons to use on Palestinians along with political support, and mediated talks have not led to a ceasefire. The war on Gaza, Israel says, is in retaliation for attacks on Israeli territory by armed groups, led by Hamas’s Qassam Brigades, from Gaza which killed 1,139 people and took about 250 captive. Let’s take a look at the toll the Israeli attacks have taken on Gaza. At least 33,137 Palestinians have been   by the Israeli army in Gaza since the start of the war on October 7, the Ministry of Health in Gaza says. Thousands more are missing under the rubble of collapsed buildings and infrastructure, and are presumed dead. Children and women comprise the overwhelming majority of those killed, with Save the Children saying more than 13,800 children have been killed. UNICEF, the United Nations fund for children, estimated that at least 17,000 Palestinian children are currently unaccompanied or separated from their parents in Gaza. At least 75,815 people have been injured in Israeli attacks since the start of the war – about four out of every 100 people in Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said this week that some 1,000 children in Gaza have lost one or both of their legs. Dozens of people are still killed and injured every day amid relentless Israeli attacks. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has grown significantly worse in 2024 as the Israeli army blocks the arrival of aid and has effectively imposed   as a weapon of war. Nearly all 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza now face starvation, with the UN saying famine will take hold in various parts of Gaza by May. Northern Gaza, which was the first to be decimated by an Israeli ground invasion, is the worst-hit – Israel continues to severely restrict access to the north, blocking routes and subjecting aid convoys to delays or cancellations. Babies and young children have died from dehydration and malnutrition in northern Gaza, but Israel is still blocking many humanitarian missions. Last week, Israeli forces   in three targeted, consecutive strikes on a convoy of cars over a stretch of 2.3km (1.4 miles), prompting some aid organisations to suspend services. The Israeli military ordered Palestinians to “go south” from the start of the war as its ground forces invaded Gaza from the north. Nobody has been able to return to their homes in northern Gaza since then as Israel has established a military corridor cutting the Strip in half. Some 1.9 million people, or more than 80 percent of Gaza’s population, have been internally  . Most are sheltering in UN installations such as schools and hospitals, nevertheless, more than 400 have been killed and at least 1,400 injured in those places. More than 1.5 million people are now crammed into Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city on the border with Egypt. Many have been forced to stay in makeshift camps or the streets, exposed to Israeli air attacks. Israel has insisted it will invade Rafah by land as well. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says more than 350 Israeli military attacks have targeted its buildings, with 161 installations damaged. The highest number of UN staff in history – 176 – have been killed in Gaza since October 7. The war has damaged or destroyed approximately 62 percent of all homes in Gaza – 290,820 housing units – leaving more than a million people without homes. The   estimated by the World Bank and the UN has also been to public service infrastructure, with 26 million tonnes of debris and rubble left by the destruction. Damage has been most extensive in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where Israeli ground and air attacks destroyed thousands of homes and infrastructure in a stated effort to combat “terrorists”. Eight of every 10 schools in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF. As many as 625,000 students have no access to education. The Israeli army has focused its attacks on hospitals across Gaza despite their protection under international law, claiming Hamas is operating within and underneath them. All hospitals have suffered critical damage, with only 10 out of 36 able to function partially but they are increasingly overburdened. A two-week-long siege in and around al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza,   by last week. The Israeli army killed at least 400 people at the compound during its siege and arrested hundreds more. An acute shortage of medicine, along with exhausted and starving healthcare professionals, means most patients are unable to receive treatment in Gaza. Many operations and amputations have had to be performed without anaesthetic. The Israeli army has killed the largest number of journalists of any modern conflict and detained more than 24. On March 18, Al Jazeera correspondent   was arrested for 12 hours and beaten by Israeli forces in al-Shifa Hospital. Before that, on January 7, Al Jazeera journalist Hamza Dahdouh, son of Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, was  . Hamza was in a vehicle near   with another journalist, Mustafa Thuraya, who was also killed in the attack. On December 15, 2023, Al Jazeera cameraman   was hit in an Israeli drone attack that also injured Wael Dahdouh, in Khan Younis, Gaza. Abudaqa bled to death over four hours as emergency workers were unable to reach him because the Israeli army would not let them. The Committee to Protect Journalists puts the number of journalists killed at 90, with the Government Media Office in Gaza saying some 140 have been killed.
