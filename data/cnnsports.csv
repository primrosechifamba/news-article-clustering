Sports,"History can weigh heavy on some. Attempting to forge a path never trodden, trying to be the first can become too burdensome a task for even the greats. The expectation, the pressure increasing with each step made towards that never-before-achieved feat.
     
            Yet two rounds, or 36 holes, away from possibly making history,  Nelly Korda  is an athlete who seems at ease with what could lie ahead.
     
            “Did a really good job of staying present and just staying in my own little bubble,” she told reporters after her second round at the Cognizant Founders Cup, before laughing at how those words could be a drinking game so often does she say them.
     
            It is the bubble which helps explain how the American was able to produce such a stunning bogey-free performance in difficult conditions in Clifton, New Jersey, to put herself back in contention for what would be a record-breaking sixth straight LPGA Tour title.
     
            Korda, the world No.1, was six shots off the lead after her first round. Her six-under-par 66 in the second round was just one of three bogey-free rounds on a wet and windy day and moved her to third on the leaderboard, four shots behind Madelene Sagstrom and Rose Zhang who share the overnight lead.
     
            At last month’s The Chevron Championship, Korda won her fifth consecutive title to join   Annika Sörenstam  and Nancy Lopez as the only players to win five in a row on the tour.
     
            Should the 25-year-old secure a remarkable sixth title in as many outings it would be one of the greatest achievements in sport. Not only can she claim to being the best female golfer in the world, but it could also strongly be argued that she is currently the best athlete on this planet. Certainly, few have been as dominant in their chosen field.
     
            “Everything is about staying very in the moment, staying very present in these kind of conditions, especially on this golf course,” she added after round two.
     
            The 13-time LPGA Tour winner, who last lost in January, has unsurprisingly been the focus of attention leading up to this tournament and her celebrity is in the ascendancy, as her attendance at the Met Gala this week testified.
     
            She told ESPN ahead of the tournament that her busy schedule meant she had not had time to think about being on the cusp of history.
     
            Again, in that interview she emphasized she would stay in the moment, take it “a shot at a time,” but also admitted recent successes had taken their toll.
     
            She opted out of competing at the JM Eagle LA Championship last month because she was exhausted.
     
            “I just felt like mentally, I just needed the rest,” Korda told ESPN. “I was just so mentally tired going through all those situations and high-pressure moments.”
     
            Refreshed and back playing, Korda has put herself in a strong position on a course in which she didn’t make the cut last year.
     
            According to the LPGA, she has only led once at the halfway mark in her previous five victories of 2024 so she is more than capable of overhauling Sagstrom and Zhang.
     
            The question is: if history looms ever closer in those closing stages, can “the bubble” protect her from the weight of trying to achieve what no one else ever has?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/sport/nelly-korda-cognizant-founders-cup-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,
Sports,"Sean Burroughs, a 2000  Olympic  gold medalist, Little League World Series winner and former first round MLB pick, died Thursday, the California-based Long Beach Little League organization  announced  Friday. He was 43.
     
            Burroughs died of a cardiac arrest, his mother, Debbie, told the Southern California News Group via text, the San Bernardino Sun  reported .
     
            According to Doug Wittman, Long Beach Little League president, Burroughs was found unresponsive next to his vehicle at the Long Beach complex after dropping his son off for a game Thursday, The Sun reported.
     
            “I have had the privilege of coaching with Sean for the past two years,” Wittman said on Instagram, and Burroughs “always came with a fun and friendly attitude the kids were drawn to, a wealth of baseball knowledge that could get any kid out of a batting rut and humility worth emulating. To say this is a huge loss is an understatement.”
     
            Burroughs won two consecutive Little League World Series titles in 1992 and 1993 for Long Beach. At 12 years old, he appeared on “The Late Show with David Letterman” after the second championship. Burroughs would later return to the team to coach his son.
     
            Burroughs also won a gold medal in baseball with Team USA at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, after the US defeated heavily favored Cuba in the final. It was the first-ever Olympic gold medal for the baseball program.
     
            “We at USA Baseball are heartbroken to hear of the tragic passing of Sean,” USA Baseball Executive Director and CEO Paul Seiler said in a  statement . “Sean was a part of one of our most beloved teams, and he represented our country on and off the field in a first-class manner.”
     
            Drafted with the ninth overall pick in the 1998 MLB Draft by the San Diego Padres, Burroughs would play seven MLB seasons with the Padres, the Tampa Bay Rays – then known as the Devil Rays – Arizona Diamondbacks and Minnesota Twins, finishing with a career .278 batting average, 12 home runs and 143 runs batted in.
     
            “We mourn the passing of former Padres third baseman Sean Burroughs,” the Padres  said  on X Friday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this very difficult time.”
     
            The Diamondbacks  added : “The #Dbacks mourn the passing of Sean Burroughs and offer our condolences to his family and friends. Sean was a member of the 2011 NL West champion team and beloved by his teammates, coaches, staff, and fans. Rest in peace, Sean.”
     
            His father, Jeff Burroughs, won the American League Most Valuable Player award in 1974 with the Texas Rangers.
     
            Mayor Rex Richardson of Long Beach, California, also expressed his condolences via his office’s social media account.
     
            “The Long Beach community mourns the passing of Sean Burroughs, who was a local hero and baseball legend,” the  post  said. “Sean was a Little League World Series Champion and Olympian. The sports community will feel his loss for years to come.”
     
            A candlelight vigil for Burroughs is scheduled at Stearns Champions Park in Long Beach on Saturday night.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/sport/sean-burroughs-dies-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,
Sports,"Former  NBA  champion Glen Davis has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for his part in a scheme to defraud the league’s health care plan out of millions of dollars, according to federal court records from the Southern District of New York.
     
            Davis, 38, was one of 18 former NBA players who were  indicted  in October 2021 after allegedly participating in a “widespread scheme to defraud” the NBA’s health plan by submitting nearly $4 million in “false and fraudulent” claims to be reimbursed for medical and dental services that had not actually been provided.
     
            Davis – whose nickname while he played in the NBA was “Big Baby” – was also ordered to pay $80,000 in restitution, according to court documents.
     
            In November, Davis was found guilty of wire fraud, health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to make false statements related to health care matters, court documents show.
     
            When approached for comment by CNN, Davis’ attorney noted his intent to appeal but declined to comment further.
     
            Former NBA player Terrence Williams was also convicted in the case, court documents show.
     
            Williams, who has been called the “leader of the conspiracy” by prosecutors, pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud in 2022, according to a judgment order. He received a 10-year prison sentence and three years of supervised release in August 2023.
     
            In addition to his prison term, Williams was to forfeit $653,672 and to pay restitution in the amount of $2,500,000, court documents show.
     
            Williams’ attorney did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
     
            CNN has reached out to the NBA for comment.
     
            Davis was selected by the Seattle Supersonics – which have since moved and have been rebranded as the Oklahoma City Thunder – with the 35th pick of the 2007 NBA Draft before having his rights traded to the Boston Celtics, playing in the NBA for eight seasons. He was part of the Celtics’ NBA title-winning team in 2008, while also going on to play for the Orlando Magic and the Los Angeles Clippers.
     
            He averaged eight points and 4.4 rebounds per game during his NBA career.
     
            A total of 16 people were arrested by the FBI following the 2021 indictment by Manhattan federal prosecutors.
     
            In 2021, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, Audrey Strauss, said the ringleader Williams allegedly obtained fraudulent medical and dental invoices, sent those invoices to his co-conspirators, who then submitted the claims to the plan, which paid “most” of their claims for procedures they never received.
     
            The scheme, Strauss said, began around November 2017.
     
            Each person allegedly tried to claim between $65,000 to as much as $420,000 in fraudulent medical service reimbursements, Strauss said. She said in many cases, the people submitting the invoices were nowhere near the location where they claimed to be receiving treatments.
     
            One former NBA player, Strauss said, submitted a bill for $48,000 claiming he had IV sedation and root canals and crowns on eight teeth on December 20, 2018, at an office in Beverly Hills, California. But Strauss said on that date, travel records and even “publicly available box scores” show the man was actually playing professional basketball in Taiwan.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/glen-davis-sentenced-prison-defraud-nba-health-plan-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,
Sports,"French football superstar Kylian Mbappé  confirmed he will leave Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the end of the season, the 25-year-old said in a  video  posted on social media Friday.
     
            Mbappé said he will not extend his contract with the French club and that he will play his final match at the Parc des Princes on Sunday when PSG hosts Toulouse.
     
            “I have always known, but I think I needed this, a new challenge after seven years,” Mbappé said. “It’s difficult and of course, there are some people I want to thank above all, these are the fans. I know I am not the most demonstrative player. I haven’t always lived up to the love you all gave me for seven years but I never want to cheat. I have always wanted to be effective.
     
            “PSG is a club that never leaves anyone indifferent. We can love it or hate it. I made the choice of loving it and I did for seven years with ups and downs of course but I do not regret, at any moment, signing with this prestigious club. It’s a club that I will keep in my memory my entire life.”
     
            The 2018 World Cup winner joined PSG as a 17-year-old in 2017 from AS Monaco, where he has since become the club’s all-time leading scorer, and led the French side to six league titles, including this season.
     
            Mbappé did not mention where he will play next year but earlier this year, he reportedly agreed to join Real Madrid.
     
            “I want to say thank you because without you all, I would have never experienced half of the emotions I felt. And just for that, I am grateful for life. Thank you all. I hope we will finish this year with a last trophy.”

Sports,"World No. 1  Novak Djokovic  was hit in the head with a water bottle following his  second-round victory  at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome, Italy, on Friday.
     
            The 36-year-old Serbian was signing autographs for spectators when he was struck by the water bottle, tournament organizers told CNN.
     
            Officials said Friday that Djokovic had returned to his hotel and that “his condition is not a cause for concern.”
     
            The incident was an accident, organizers said, and provided video showing the bottle falling out of a spectator’s backpack.
     
            Djokovic later posted on X, formerly Twitter, thanking fans for their messages.
     
            “This was an accident and I am fine resting at the hotel with an ice pack. See you all on Sunday,” he said.

Sports,"Rafael Nadal  said he is unsure whether he will be able to play at the  French Open  for likely the final time later this month, after he was defeated in the second round of the Italian Open by Hubert Hurkacz on Saturday.
     
            “The decision (to appear at the French Open) as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today,” the 22-time grand slam winner said afterwards, according to the ATP Tour.
     
            “But if I have to say what’s my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I’m going to say I will be in Roland Garros and try my best.”
     
            Nadal succumbed to a 6-1 6-3 defeat against world No. 9 Hurkacz in Rome, in what was likely his last appearance at a tournament he has won a record 10 times. He is still struggling with the injuries that have derailed his comeback after undergoing hip surgery last season.
     
            He said last May that 2024 will likely be his last year on tour, and so the upcoming French Open represents possibly his last chance to play at a tournament with which he will forever be associated, and which he dominated during his heyday.
     
            The 37-year-old Spaniard accumulated a record 14 titles at Roland Garros, the most recent coming in 2022, but he was forced to withdraw last year due to injury before the tournament began, missing it for the first time since he made his debut in 2005.
     
            Nadal told reporters on Saturday that there were two ways for him to approach this year’s French Open.
     
            “Probably one is to say, ‘Okay, I am not ready, I am not playing well enough.’ Then is the moment to take a decision in terms of not playing Roland Garros. Another is to accept how I am today and work the proper way to try to be in a different way in two weeks,” he said, according to the ATP.
     
            “Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say not playing in the most important event of my tennis career.
     
            “Let’s see what’s going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week. If I feel ready, I’m going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting the last 15 years, even if now it seems impossible.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/sport/rafael-nadal-french-open-italian-open-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,
