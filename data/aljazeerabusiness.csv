Business,"As the world’s largest — and one of its most unequal — democracies votes in a mammoth national election, a new debate has gripped the campaigns of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party. At the heart of this latest political slugfest is the idea of a potential redistribution of wealth. But while the Congress party has alluded to the need for some resources to be reallocated to traditional marginalised economic and caste-based communities, Modi and the BJP have accused the opposition of plotting to hand over wealth from Hindu households to Muslims. So what’s the controversy about and what do economists say about the proposals for a relook at India’s wealth distribution? In April, Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, said if voted to office, his Congress party would conduct a caste census along with an economic and institutional survey to determine who owns what and earns how much. Following this, a portion of the 16 trillion rupees ($192bn) of benefits given to 22 big Businessmen by the Modi government would be transferred to 90 percent of the country’s people, as a starting point for delivering social justice, he said. Gandhi described the caste census as an “X-ray” into Indian society. “This is not a political issue for me, this is my life mission,” Gandhi said. “You can write down; no force can stop the caste census.’’ The Congress party manifesto doesn’t talk directly about redistribution of wealth.  It says, “We will address the growing inequality of wealth and income through suitable changes in policies.’’  On the caste-based census, it says, “Congress will conduct a nation-wide Socio-Economic and Caste Census to enumerate the castes and sub-castes and their socio-economic conditions. Based on the data, we will strengthen the agenda for affirmative action.” Yet, responding to Gandhi’s speech, Modi has been repeating in election rallies that the Congress party has hatched a “deep conspiracy’’ to snatch the wealth of people and gold of Hindu women to distribute it among Muslims, whom he described as “infiltrators” and “those who have more children”. The opposition has accused Modi of resorting to “lies” and “hate speech” to distract people from high unemployment and rising prices, and has complained to the election commission. India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world, but also suffers from deepening inequality. Numerous studies have shown that the benefits of India’s brisk growth have been unevenly distributed. A new study by researchers at the World Inequality Lab shows that income and wealth inequality in India today is, in many ways, worse than it was even under British colonial rule. India’s richest 1 percent control 22.6 percent of national income and more than 40 percent of the country’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent control less than 10 percent of national wealth. Inequality was worsened over the past decade of Modi’s rule. India has   third behind only China and the US — and world’s highest number of poor at 228.9 million, according to  . The Congress party has accused the Modi government of ‘crony capitalism’ and favouring certain Businesses in government contracts. The government has denied the accusations saying it has not favoured companies and has instead invested in welfare programmes to improve the lives of the poor. Experts say India’s inequality is the result of the prevailing economic and political system. Even as both governments of the BJP and the Congress have launched reforms and pushed for economic growth over the past three decades, they have failed to generate enough employment, check inflation, and move the workforce from low-income farming to well-paying non-farm jobs, resulting in high inequality of wealth and income. There is no one view among economists. Those against the idea say redistribution will be counterproductive by taking capital from wealth generators thereby handicapping and disincentivising them to contribute to the economy. But others argue that redistribution is required not only in wealth but also in opportunities like education, healthcare, access to financial resources, water and energy, which will boost poor people’s capacity to generate income and reduce inequality in the long run. Redistribution of income and wealth is a very good idea in contemporary India, said Deepankar Basu, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “The high and rising level of economic inequality suggests that the economic system does not work equally for all. The wealth and income being generated by the system is predominantly being cornered by the rich,” said Basu. “Not only does this have economic implications, but it also distorts the democratic process — extreme wealth inequality allows the super-wealthy to disproportionately influence the political process through various channels like campaign contributions and donations to political parties. This erodes the democratic system of governance.’’ Devashish Mitra, professor of economics, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, New York, agreed that some wealth distribution “might not be a bad idea”. “But it is a politically contentious issue, and there might be political problems in enacting any kind of means to redistribute wealth,’’ Mitra acknowledged. One solution, Mitra said, might be to combine wealth redistribution with “some reduction in income taxes”. That would partially compensate for the wealth redistribution. “Then, we will have a combination of wealth taxes and income taxes that could lead to both greater equity and greater efficiency than in the current situation,’’ he said. The Congress is arguing that data from a caste-based census will help with the implementation of welfare and social security schemes. The party has promised to raise a Supreme Court-mandated cap on reservations in higher education and government jobs for underprivileged groups called Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). If successful, this political pitch could in theory help the Congress break the BJP’s growing stranglehold over the Hindu vote across castes and sub-communities. Modi, in turn, has responded by alleging that the Congress wants to give Muslims benefits that are meant to be allocated on caste — not religious — lines. He has cited a 2006 speech by then Congress Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where he said disadvantaged communities and religious minorities, including Muslims, should have the first claim on national resources. The Congress has insisted that it has no wealth redistribution plan, and that Singh’s 2006 comments had been misinterpreted. In an April 24 television interview, Sam Pitroda, an adviser to the Nehru-Gandhi family and head of the overseas wing of the Congress party, added another twist to the debate by arguing that India should debate whether an inheritance tax might help reduce wealth inequality. Modi has responded by accusing the Congress of plotting a wealth and inheritance tax that would snatch away people’s wealth accumulated through hard work. The Congress, he said, aims to loot people “zindagi ke saath bhi aur zindagi ke baad bhi” (in life, and after death), echoing the popular tagline of the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation. अब कांग्रेस का कहना है कि वो Inheritance Tax लगाएगी, माता-पिता से मिलने वाली विरासत पर भी टैक्स लगाएगी। आप जो अपनी मेहनत से संपत्ति जुटाते हैं, वो आपके बच्चों को नहीं मिलेगी। कांग्रेस का पंजा वो भी आपसे लूट लेगा।   कांग्रेस का मंत्र है- कांग्रेस की लूट… जिंदगी के साथ भी,…  — BJP (@BJP4India)  The Congress party distanced itself from Pitroda comments by saying his view does not reflect the position of the party. Jairam Ramesh, a spokesman of the Congress party, referred to past comments by BJP ministers in favour of an inheritance tax. Modi has clarified that the BJP has no intention to bring such a tax. An inheritance tax, also known as estate tax or death duty in some countries, is a levy imposed on the total value of money and property of a deceased person before it is passed on to their heirs. Generally, this tax is determined by assessing the value of the assets remaining after certain exemptions or deductions. Essentially, the government collects a share of the wealth transferred from the deceased to their beneficiaries. Globally, inheritance taxes are widespread in nations including the UK, Japan, France, and Finland. The United States does not impose an inheritance tax at the federal level, though it has an estate tax. However, six states independently retain inheritance tax regimes. There is no estate duty or inheritance tax payable in India. Estate duty on property that is passed on to the legal heirs on the death of a person was removed in 1985 by the then Congress government of Rajiv Gandhi — Rahul’s father — citing the need to simplify the tax system and promote investment and saving. However, other taxes such as capital gains tax, wealth tax, and gift tax are applied to inheritances depending on the circumstances. Before the removal, estate duty was payable on a slab basis ranging approximately from 7.5 percent to 40 percent of the principal value of the estate. This estate tax was introduced in 1953 in a bid to reduce economic inequality. In recent years, worldwide, there has been a trend towards scrapping estate or inheritance tax. Five European countries have   their estate or inheritance taxes since 2000. On the other hand, US President Joe Biden has been supporting higher   on inherited wealth. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said inheritance tax could nullify India’s decade of progress. Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India has said that while inclusive growth will aid in the expansion of the economy, taxing the rich more is not the way to do that. Other economists back an inheritance tax. “An inheritance tax will make the whole economic system fairer by redistributing some of the accumulated wealth away from the children of wealthy people,’’ said Basu. “These tax revenues can then be used to finance public education, provide public healthcare and affordable housing, and support mitigation efforts related to the negative effects of climate change, which disproportionately impacts the poor.’’ Syracuse University’s Mitra said that while an inheritance tax might make some economic sense, he sees “enormous scope for corruption, stemming from the subjectivity in the valuation of inheritances and the unlimited scope in misreporting the actual value of inheritances”. Progressive taxation and greater social spending could be other solutions to  . A greater emphasis on   such as capital income taxation, net wealth taxation, and transfer taxation would generate tax revenue that could allow greater investment in health, education and infrastructure. “There are many policies that can be adopted to address rising economic inequality in India,’’ said Basu. “These include increasing the tax rate for the top 1 percent of income earners, increasing the corporate tax rate on relatively large firms, improving educational opportunities and making them accessible for the poor.’’",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/8/a-new-election-debate-should-india-take-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor,Al Jazeera,"Should India take from the rich, give the poor?

Business,"Air safety officials in the United States are investigating whether employees at Boeing falsified inspections records for the 787 Dreamliner. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that it had opened the probe after Boeing voluntarily informed officials that it may not have completed required inspections to “confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes”. “The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records. At the same time, Boeing is reinspecting all 787 airplanes still within the production system and must also create a plan to address the in-service fleet,” an FAA spokesperson said in a statement. “As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action – as always – to ensure the safety of the flying public.” Boeing raised its concerns after an employee observed an “irregularity” and raised the issue with a supervisor, Scott Stocker, head of the Boeing 787 programme, said in an email to staff. “We quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,” Stocker said. Stocker said that Boeing “promptly informed our regulator about what we learned and are taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates.” “Fortunately, our engineering team has assessed that this misconduct did not create an immediate safety of flight issue,” Stocker said. “But it will impact our customers and factory teammates, because the test now needs to be conducted out of sequence on airplanes in the build process. I know this frustrates all of you as much as it frustrates me, and it’s a reminder of why it’s so critical that each of us does our part, every day, to ensure full compliance with our policies and procedures. And to speak up if you see something that doesn’t seem right.” The probe comes after a Boeing whistleblower made separate allegations of serious flaws in the production of the 787 at a Senate committee hearing last month. Boeing’s safety record has been under intense scrutiny since   of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Following the near-disaster, the FAA barred Boeing from expanding production of the 737 MAX and ordered it to present a plan to address “systemic quality-control issues” within 90 days. The mid-air blowout was the latest incident to tarnish Boeing’s image after two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/7/us-officials-probe-claims-boeing-workers-falsified-inspection-records,Al Jazeera,US officials probe allegations Boeing workers falsified inspection records
Business,"– When Aamir Dhedhi took his mother to India in 2014 to get treatment for Parkinson’s disease, the doctors there advised him to procure cannabidiol (CBD) oil to help her manage her pain. It was the first time that Dhedhi, a Karachi-based entrepreneur, learned about the medicinal use of the cannabis derivative. On returning to Pakistan, the Businessman ordered a small quantity of the oil from the United States. Almost instantly, it helped calm his mother’s nerves and reduce tremors, he said. Dhedhi became a firm believer in CBD’s benefits. “Seeing the oil’s impact on my mother’s wellbeing, this has grown into a passion project for me,” the 49-year-old Businessman told Al Jazeera. While his mother eventually passed away in 2020, Dhedhi said he has since seen others get relief from CBD oil. “Now, I want to help our local growers expand their production and help spread its usage,” he said. Dhedhi is not alone in wanting to develop a homegrown industry for medicinal cannabis. In February, Pakistan approved the passage of an ordinance that created the Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (CCRA), a body tasked with “regulating the cultivation, extraction, refining, manufacturing, and sale of cannabis derivatives for medical and industrial purposes”. The regulatory body will be overseen by a 13-member board, which will include representatives from different government departments, intelligence agencies as well as the private sector. The establishment of the regulatory body, which was first proposed in 2020 under the tenure of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, points to Pakistan’s efforts to tap into a fast-growing and lucrative global cannabis-derivatives-related industry. According to Ireland-based Research and Markets, a research organisation, the global cannabidiol market, which stood at nearly $7bn in 2022, is expected to cross $30bn by 2027. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant that gives users a high, CBD is not psychoactive and believed to have therapeutic effects. It is increasingly prescribed by doctors to help with anxiety, chronic and acute pain, and other medical conditions. Syed Hussain Abidi – the chairman of the Pakistan Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (PCSIR), a government-owned research organisation, and member of the board of governors of the CCRA – said the creation of the regulator was a requirement of United Nations laws. “The UN laws say that if a country wants to produce, process and conduct sales of cannabis-related products, it must have a federal entity that will deal with supply chain and ensure international compliance,” he told Al Jazeera. The regulatory framework for the CCRA specifies the maximum level of THC in the cannabis derivative to be 0.3 percent to avoid the abuse of medicinal products and use them recreationally. The ordinance has laid out strict penalties for any violation of laws, with fines ranging from 10 million Pakistani rupees ($35,000) to 200 million Pakistani rupees ($716,000), with monitoring and inspection conducted in tandem with Pakistan’s Anti-Narcotics force. Abidi said the country could use cultivation of the herb to its advantage and generate revenue through export, foreign investment and domestic sales to shore up its precarious foreign reserves. Until now, Pakistani law has barred the cultivation of cannabis, but the country’s northwestern region, particularly the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is home to thousands of hectares of land where the crop has been cultivated for hundreds of years. For the most part, governments have chosen to look away rather than crack down. But the February ordinance aims to change that. On the one hand, it talks about “regulating” the area where cannabis is cultivated in the country, and issuing licences to farmers for growing the plant. On the other hand, the new regulatory regime could give the government a clearer mandate to penalise those who produce cannabis without a licence. The National Cannabis Policy, which the PCSIR prepared last year and which served as the basis of the ordinance, mentions that the broader goal of the regulations is to curb the “illegal and prevailing cultivation of cannabis”. “Technically, now the cultivation is legal since the ordinance has been passed, but we are still in [the] process of developing rules and procedures and awaiting registration of the authority,” Abidi said. Licences, it is expected, will be issued for five-year periods. The federal government will designate areas where cannabis can be grown legally. Abidi said said that according to estimates, there are nearly 28,000 hectares (70,000 acres) of land – mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some in the southwestern province of Balochistan – where cannabis is grown. “We have a long-established tradition of cannabis cultivation,” he said. “We need to avail this opportunity.” Dhedhi, the Karachi-based entrepreneur, agrees. He is partnering with farmers in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to help modernise their cultivation methods and improve the efficiency as well as the quality of the product. Cannabis in Pakistan is traditionally grown outdoors, relying on sunlight, and with minimal use of pesticides, fertilisers or any other chemical substances. This organic nature of Pakistani cannabis makes it different from that which is mass-produced in many other nations, but it also means that both the quality and quantity of the production are less reliable. “We have massive potential in this field to provide health benefits through CBD. There is an opportunity to provide cheaper medical alternatives to people, which can help our domestic users as well as [improve the] potential for export,” Dhedhi said. “That can bring in financial rewards to our local growers.” More than 1,500km (930 miles) north of Karachi is the Tirah Valley, a vast mountainous tract of land situated between the tribal districts of Khyber and Orakzai in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There, Suleman Shah, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer-turned-farmer, shares Dhedhi’s dream. Shah has been running the family’s cannabis farms for the past eight years, and his staff of nearly 40 people plant cannabis on nearly 200 acres (81 hectares) of land. Most farmers in the region, he said, were unaware of the medicinal qualities of hemp and primarily grow the plant for its recreational characteristics, using traditional methods. Though cultivating cannabis has been illegal, Shah said he never faced any reprimand from the government. Still, farmers like him have faced other challenges. Cannabis cultivated in neighbouring Afghanistan – with even less government oversight – had previously meant that Pakistani cannabis faced tough competition in the local recreational use market. The neighbours have long had a fairly porous border. “When there used to be cannabis cultivation in Afghanistan, we would often be in loss, unable to recoup our investment in growing the plant. But since [the] Taliban have placed a ban, our Business is doing considerably better,” the farmer said, referring to the Afghan Taliban, who returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Before the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, Shah said he was earning about 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($180) per acre, just barely sufficient to meet the cost of production. “However, the last two years have been better. Take this year for example, when I was able to make nearly 500,000 rupees ($1,800) per acre,” he said. “If the government brings on the regulatory framework, it will only help the farmers more,” Shah told Al Jazeera. “They can provide expertise to the farmers, help them research and grow better quality of products for the people, allowing to move beyond just the recreational use.” Globally, one litre (0.26 gallons) of CBD oil is priced at between $6,000 and $10,000, depending on quality. “This is the potential we need to tap into by modernising our cultivation and processing methods,” Shah said. Not everyone, however, is convinced that Pakistan’s shift towards embracing cannabis production will give its economy the kick it needs. Fawad Chaudhry, a former federal minister who is credited with kickstarting the conversation around facilitating CBD and industrial hemp production in late 2020, said that the four-year delay since then in getting the plan off the ground means Pakistan has been “late to the party”. “My suggestion [in 2020] was simply that you allocate space for growth of the plant, issue international tenders for investors and let them come here. But we wasted our potential and threw away the time advantage,” he told Al Jazeera. “The world has moved forward.” Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen, the chief executive and co-founder of Formula Swiss, a Switzerland-based cannabis producer and global distributor, agreed. Krigslund-Hansen said that while he favoured countries taking steps in the “right direction” by showing interest in the medicinal usage of cannabis, there was a risk of over-saturation in the market. “Germany has recently legalised it. China is a major producer. Latin American countries are doing it as well. So, you have a lot of production from different countries, but when everybody is a producer and seller, then who will be the buyer?” the Businessman asked. He questioned whether Pakistan had the capacity to produce medicinal-grade cannabis that could meet global standards. “If you want to sell medical grade cannabis, it must be produced indoors, ensuring consistency and uniform production. When you grow it indoors, the electricity costs will be exceptionally high to keep the lights and air conditioning, all to make sure that the product remains top-grade throughout,” he said. “And this will cost a significant amount of money.” Abidi, the government official, however, remained optimistic when asked about these challenges. He acknowledged that Pakistan needed more resources to “hygienically produce cannabis” but said that his organisation had been tasked by the government to develop processes to improve the quality of the product. “We have developed end-to-end solutions to extract top-quality CBD oil and currently, we are carrying out our research and extraction in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar in our pilot project,” he said. “We are anticipating that in three years, we can easily generate revenues of over $1.5bn, domestic sales and exports combined.” Shah, the farmer, said he is also developing indigenous ways to improve production methods with the help of entrepreneurs like Dhedhi and insisted that the organic, outdoor nature of Pakistani cannabis growth was its defining feature. “We will be using plastic sheets to cover our plantation instead of building greenhouses. We are developing methods to stop cross-pollination,” he said. Abidi, the board member, acknowledged the stigma associated with the use of cannabis products in a conservative society like Pakistan but said that the government was counting on growing awareness of the benefits of CBD among young people. “The regulatory framework will ensure that people will get only the prescribed, medicinal use products, [and] it will crack down on the illegal sales and consumption of marijuana,” he said. “Once the clean product goes for retail, it will help curtail [the] black market, and only patients with prescriptions can access it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/8/pakistan-bets-on-a-cannabis-high-as-its-economy-struggles,Al Jazeera,Pakistan bets on a cannabis high as its economy struggles

Amazon said the investment would support more than 12,000 jobs at Singaporean Businesses each year and $23.7bn worth of value to Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP). Amazon’s announcement is the latest in a series of moves by United States-based tech titans to expand their footprint in Southeast Asia.

Business,"Elon Musk suggested testing Tesla’s full self-driving feature in China by deploying it in robotaxis, Chinese state media has reported. During  , officials told the Tesla CEO that Beijing “welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country” and hopes it can “set a good example”, the state-backed China Daily reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. Chinese authorities, however, did not immediately approve Tesla’s widespread use of the Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature, the newspaper said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The China Daily report follows an unannounced visit by Musk to Beijing late last month, during which he held talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. During his visit, Musk received an endorsement of Tesla’s data-security procedures from a top Chinese auto association and sealed an agreement with Chinese tech giant Baidu to use its mapping licence for data collection on China’s public roads. Tesla still needs to get approval from Chinese regulators to collect and transfer data used to train its software before it can fully roll out FSD, which the China Daily said was not discussed on Musk’s visit. Tesla operates its biggest manufacturing plant outside the United States in Shanghai, where about half of its vehicles are produced. Musk has shifted Tesla’s focus away from making affordable electric cars towards burgeoning technology, such as autonomous driving software, robotaxis and humanoid robots. The electric car maker is struggling with falling car sales amid fierce competition from Chinese brands such as BYD. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries fell by 8.5 percent in the first quarter, contributing to a 40 percent slide in its stock price since July. The company last month reported profits of $1.1bn in the first quarter, down from $2.51bn a year ago. Chinese auto giant BYD dethroned Tesla as the world’s biggest electric vehicle maker in the last quarter of 2023, although the Austin, Texas-based company reclaimed the title in the first three months of this year.

Business,"Air India was once so renowned for its service that Singapore’s founding statesman Lee Kuan Yew used the airline as a blueprint for launching the city-state’s own flag carrier in the early 1970s. In recent decades, India’s national airline came to be seen as a cautionary tale of decline as it racked up billions of dollars in losses and battled a reputation for tardiness and poor service. When the Tata Group bought the company in October 2021, returning control to the wealthy Tata family after decades of state ownership, CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran laid out a clear objective: “To build a world-class airline”. Tasked with leading this mission is Air India CEO Campbell Wilson, who was recruited from Singapore’s low-cost airline Scoot in 2022 to turn around the carrier, founded in 1932 by French-Indian aviator entrepreneur JRD Tata. “Standards have slipped considerably over the years,” Wilson told Al Jazeera in an exclusive interview. But Wilson is adamant that “the journey to restoring Air India to its former glory is well under way” under a five-year turnaround plan unveiled last year. The Tata Group has spent tens of billions in transforming the company in recent years, investing in 470 new aircraft, cabin modernisation, a brand refresh and customer service changes. After the “capital-intensive” five-year plan is completed, Air India hopes to capitalise on the huge growth potential of the Indian aviation market, the world’s third-largest with some 145 million domestic passengers annually. The Tata Group’s initial priority has been its ageing fleet, the upkeep of which has been neglected for decades. Shortly after the ownership change, Air India added 36 leased aircraft – 11 Boeing 777s and 25 Airbus A320s – which allowed the airline to launch six new international routes and increase frequency across a further 24. Air India’s largest investment came with its   to buy 470 new Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a cost of $70bn, including 140 A320neos, 70 A321neos, and 190 of the 737 MAX. Wilson said the acquisitions will enable Air India to “operate the most advanced and fuel-efficient fleet within five years”. The airline also plans to spend $400m to retrofit its existing fleet by refurbishing cabin interiors. Wilson said the retrofit will initially focus on the airline’s narrow-body A320neo and A321neo aircraft, after which 40 legacy wide-body Boeing 777s and 787s will receive a “complete makeover with all new interiors”. Other changes to improve onboard service include introducing premium economy seats on selected long-haul flights and new food menus. Henry H Harteveldt, the president of Atmosphere Research Group, said the Tata Group’s investments may help to build a foundation for Air India to succeed, but the changes will not matter much if the airline does not manage to be reliable and punctual. Above all else, Air India should strive to be seen as “the on-time machine”, Harteveldt told Al Jazeera. “If a service isn’t considered reliable, customers won’t have the confidence to book with that airline,” he said. 		 		 The Tata Group’s biggest challenge of all may be addressing Air India’s damaged relationship with its customers. Apart from recurring issues with reliability and punctuality, the airline’s image has been tarnished by high-profile controversies involving its customer service, such as an incident in February in which an 80-year-old passenger collapsed after being forced to walk 1.5km (2.4 miles) from the plane to the immigration counter due to a shortage of wheelchairs. John Gradek, an expert in aviation management at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, said that Air India’s fleet renewal efforts will fail to revive the airline’s fortunes unless it can establish a “new customer service mindset among its customer-facing staff”, a task that has proven difficult “for many airlines looking to grow their international brand”. More than two years after the Tata Group’s takeover of Air India, the airline’s turnaround plan has completed its first phase. Its achievements so far include a $200m investment in new IT to boost reliability and the recruitment of more than 3,800 new employees across several areas to support growth. Harteveldt said the investment in IT was especially welcome as Air India has been “tech-starved for a long time because of the Indian government’s inability or unwillingness to invest in the airline adequately”. For the Tata Group, the progression has continued into 2024 with the scheduling of new international routes with the newly delivered Airbus A350-900 between Delhi and Dubai. Additional changes, such as consolidating carrier Vistara into Air India, are expected to occupy Tata’s focus for the remainder of 2024, in keeping with Chandrasekaran’s view of consolidation as “an important milestone in the journey to make Air India a truly world-class airline”. There are also internal issues with its subsidiary Air India Express, which has both domestic and international flights. Since Tuesday, it has cancelled at least 90 flights as more than 100 crew members have called in sick at the last minute, essentially a strike action reportedly over pay and related matters. Cancellations across the Indian budget carrier represent owner Tata Group’s second setback in as many months, as Vistara was forced to adjust its schedule with flight cancellations amid a pilot shortage only in April. Harteveldt said the “devil is in the details when it comes to airline mergers”. If the airline teams can “be transparent, even humble”, operational faults can be smoothed out during the integration’s initial months, he said. After being in the government’s hands for more than half a century, Air India’s recovery is expected to take time, Harteveldt said, but there is “no reason in the world why, with the right investments and focus, Air India can’t successfully distinguish itself from other Indian-based airlines”. Wilson said Air India’s long-term goal is to grow its market share to 30 percent both domestically and internationally by 2027. The goal, he said, is to create an airline that is “bold, confident, and vibrant, but also warm and deeply rooted to its rich history, traditions, and warm Indian hospitality”. Still, Wilson said he is under no illusions that the turnaround will happen overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/9/after-years-of-decline-air-india-is-betting-millions-on-a-comeback,Al Jazeera,"After decades of decline, Air India is betting billions on a comeback"
Business,"– The Wall Street Journal has announced staff cuts at its Hong Kong bureau as it shifts its “center of gravity in the region” to Singapore, marking the latest blow to the financial hub’s once-thriving media industry. Editor-in-chief Emma Tucker told staff in a company-wide memo on Thursday that the newspaper was following the same path that “many of the companies we cover have done”. The cuts include six editorial staff in Hong Kong and two reporters at the newspaper’s Singapore office, two sources familiar with the matter told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. In her memo, Tucker said “some of our colleagues, mostly in Hong Kong, will be leaving us”, while listing several new positions in Singapore, including an editor and several reporters. “At the core of these changes is the creation of a new Business, finance and economics group,” she said. “This unites what had been separate teams under one banner with a common goal: Focus on the biggest money stories in Asia – the rise of China’s EV industry, the chip war, China Shock 2.0, the struggles of Hong Kong’s finance industry and China’s stunning property bust.” The WSJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since the imposition of a Beijing-decreed national security law and some of the world’s toughest pandemic curbs in 2020, numerous international companies have departed Hong Kong or scaled bank operations in the city, shifting resources elsewhere. China’s economic slowdown has also impacted the work of the army of analysts and financiers who thrived in Hong Kong’s once-free-wheeling atmosphere, in turn informing the coverage of media outlets such as the WSJ. Earlier this year, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell to its lowest levels since 1997, the year the former British colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty, in what was widely seen as an ominous sign for the future of the city’s economy – although the market has rebounded over 10 percent during the last month. Hundreds of thousands of expatriate and local residents have departed the city in recent years, many of them driven to leave by harsh zero-COVID curbs and a national security crackdown that has weakened rights and freedoms that are supposed to be guaranteed until 2047 under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials have argued that a greater focus on national security has been necessary to restore peace and stability to the city after mass antigovernment protests in 2019 that devolved into widespread property destruction and clashes with police. Several local independent news outlets have shuttered under political pressure, while international media including The New York Times and Radio Free Asia have shifted editorial positions to cities such as Seoul and Taipei. Once known as one of the freest media environments in Asia, Hong Kong ranks 135 out of 180 countries and territories in Reporters without Borders’ (RSF) latest media freedom index released on Friday, falling between the Philippines and South Sudan.

Business,"European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen has said she will push for competition with China that is “fair and not distorted” in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “I have made clear that the current imbalances in market access are not sustainable and need to be addressed,” von der Leyen, who is the president of the EU Commission, said hours ahead of a meeting between her, Xi and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Xi on Sunday began a three-country tour of Europe as EU officials are probing the trade practices of Chinese firms operating in the bloc. The European Commission last week opened an investigation to determine if European suppliers of medical devices are given fair market access in China. The inquiry follows similar probes into Chinese wind turbine suppliers and Chinese subsidies for solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs) and trains. European carmakers such as Volkswagen and Renault are losing ground to   makers, which have received billions of dollars worth of state subsidies in recent years. EU officials are also concerned about Chinese spying and Beijing’s military cooperation with Russia as Moscow prosecutes its war on Ukraine. Von der Leyen on Sunday reiterated the bloc’s position that it should “derisk” ties with China but not decouple from the world’s second-largest economy, in contrast with Washington’s aggressive moves to shut out key Chinese industries entirely. “We have been very clear-eyed about our relationship with China, which is one of the most complex, but also one of the most important,” she said. But Von der Leyen said the EU could not accept “market-distorting practices”. “China is currently manufacturing, with massive subsidies, more than it is selling due to its own weak domestic demand. This is leading to an oversupply of Chinese subsidised goods, such as EVs and steel, that is leading to unfair trade,” she said. Von der Leyen said she would encourage Xi to address “overcapacities” in the short term. Xi’s visit is seen as a test of the EU’s efforts to walk a fine line between Beijing and Washington, with the Chinese leader widely expected to attempt to exploit divisions between Western allies. While European leaders have qualms about Beijing’s growing power and influence, the bloc is divided over how to respond to the heated US-China rivalry. Macron, who is treating Xi to the formal honours of a full state visit, has often warned against Europe becoming a US vassal and is widely seen to be attempting to forge a third way in geopolitical relations. “In Europe, we are not unanimous on the subject because certain players still see China as essentially a market of opportunities,” Macron said in an interview with French newspaper La Tribune ahead of Xi’s visit. After a two-day visit to France, Xi will travel to Serbia and Hungary, both of which are seen as friendly with Beijing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/6/eus-von-der-leyen-to-urge-fair-china-competition-in-talks-with-xi,Al Jazeera,EU’s von der Leyen to urge ‘fair’ China competition in talks with Xi
Business,"ByteDance, the owner of the  , has filed a lawsuit against the United States government in an effort to block a law that would force it to  . On Tuesday, lawyers for ByteDance filed the complaint in the US Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, arguing the law was “obviously unconstitutional”. President Joe Biden signed the law less than two weeks ago, on April 24, as part of a package that included foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel, as well as humanitarian relief for Gaza. Under the law, ByteDance has nine months to sell off its US-based operations. Its deadline is January 19, with an additional three-month extension possible should a sale be in progress. But in its suit, ByteDance argues divestment will not be possible within the timeframe allotted — “not commercially, not technologically, not legally”. It also argues it is being unfairly targeted by a law that violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects free speech. “For the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide,” the lawsuit reads. While ByteDance maintained it has no plans to sell TikTok, its  , it said that doing so   under the law. Millions of lines of code would have to shift hands, the lawsuit explained, and any prospective owners would have to access ByteDance’s algorithms to keep it operational — something that would also be barred under the law. “There is no question: the Act will force a shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025, silencing the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere,” the lawsuit said. TikTok has been a target of bipartisan criticism in the US, with politicians concerned about its national security implications. ByteDance is a Chinese technology company, and its critics fear that the Chinese government could request the information it collects from users, raising privacy concerns. US Congress members like Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi said the April law is therefore necessary to protect US users. “This is the only way to address the national security threat posed by ByteDance’s ownership of apps like TikTok,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. “Instead of continuing its deceptive tactics, it’s time for ByteDance to start the divestment process.” 		 		 ByteDance has long denied furnishing any information about US users to the Chinese government, and it has publicly pledged not to do so, brushing aside such concerns as “speculative”. The lawsuit also notes that the company spent $2bn to protect US user data and has made commitments under a 90-page draft “National Security Agreement” with the US government. TikTok has been in the US government’s crosshairs for nearly four years, as tensions continue between Washington and Beijing. In 2020, for instance, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ban the video platform, citing national security concerns. But federal judges blocked the ban, saying that officials demonstrated a “failure to consider an obvious and reasonable alternative before banning TikTok”. States have similarly sought to block the app, most notably Montana. In April 2023, Governor Greg Gianforte signed a first-of-its-kind bill, SB 419, that would fine TikTok for operating within state lines, as well as any app stores that carried it. But it was unclear how Montana planned to enforce the law, which was quickly challenged in court. Montana’s SB 419 was scheduled to take effect on January 1, but a federal judge ultimately blocked it, awarding another win to ByteDance. The state’s attorney general has promised an appeal. 		 		 Many free-speech advocates   awaits April’s federal law forcing ByteDance to sever itself from its US operations. Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told the Associated Press that he anticipated ByteDance would prevail in Tuesday’s lawsuit. “The First Amendment means the government can’t restrict Americans’ access to ideas, information, or media from abroad without a very good reason for it — and no such reason exists here,” Jaffer said in a statement. For its part, China has taken similar actions against US-based companies like Meta, whose WhatsApp and Threads platforms were recently ordered to be removed from Chinese-based app stores over questions of national security.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/7/tiktok-owner-bytedance-files-lawsuit-against-us-law-forcing-apps-sale,Al Jazeera,TikTok owner ByteDance files lawsuit against US law forcing app’s sale
Business,"Toyota has reported record profit and sales figures on the back of the weak yen and strong demand for hybrid vehicles. The Japanese car giant said on Wednesday that it netted a record profit of 4.94 trillion yen ($31.9bn) in the year to March on revenues of 45.1 trillion yen, double the previous year’s income. Global sales topped 10.3 million units, an all-time high, buoyed by strong demand in the home market and in North America and Europe. Sales of hybrid vehicles jumped 31 percent to 3.7 million units. The financial results far exceeded a company forecast in February of a 4.5 trillion yen net profit on revenues of 43.5 trillion yen. Toyota offered a more sober outlook for the current year, estimating profit would fall nearly 28 percent due to increased investment. The carmaker aims to sell 10.95 million vehicles worldwide this year, down 1.3 percent from 2023. “We’ll make investments in order to firmly protect the supply chain from a perspective of sustainable growth,” Toyota CEO Koji Sato said at a news conference after the release of the results. “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need [to] keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Sato added. While Toyota blazed a trail in the hybrid space with the release of the Prius in 1997, it has faced criticism for being slow to embrace fully electric cars. Toyota sold just 116,500 fully electric vehicles in 2023, while China’s BYD and Tesla shifted about 1.6 million and 1.8 million, respectively. Nevertheless, Toyota’s hybrid-first strategy has paid dividends over the last year amid falling demand for electric vehicles in the United States and Europe. Despite falling behind Tesla and BYD in the electric vehicles space, Toyota, which offers more than two dozen hybrid models, has held the title of the world’s largest automaker by sales for four straight years. In January, Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda expressed scepticism that battery electric vehicles would ever dominate the market, predicting they would peak at about 30 percent of sales.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/8/japans-toyota-posts-record-profit-as-hybrid-sales-surge-31-percent,Al Jazeera,Japan’s Toyota posts record profit as bet on hybrids pays dividends
Business,"​​Australia’s flagship airline Qantas has agreed to pay $120 million Australian dollars ($79m) to settle a lawsuit over the sale of tickets for already cancelled flights. The airline will pay a fine of 100 million Australian dollars ($66m) and provide compensation of 20 million Australian dollars ($13m) to more than 86,000 customers after advertising seats for thousands of “ghost flights” in 2021 and 2022. “Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, Business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” said Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb in a statement on Monday. “Importantly, it demonstrates that we take action to ensure that companies operating in Australia communicate clearly, accurately and honestly with their customers at all times,” Cass-Gottlieb added. Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said the settlement, which is subject to court approval, was an “important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier.” “When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry,” Hudson said. “The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.” Qantas, which reported an annual profit of $1.1bn last year, has faced a barrage of controversies in recent years over rising ticket prices, claims of poor service standards, and the firing of 1,700 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. In September, then-CEO Alan Joyce brought forward his retirement by two months after 15 years in the top job amid widespread criticism of the airline.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/6/australias-qantas-to-pay-66m-over-ghost-flights-furore,Al Jazeera,Australia’s Qantas to pay $79m over ‘ghost flights’ furore
Business,"Boeing has called off the inaugural crewed flight CST-100 Starliner space capsule after engineers detected an issue with a rocket valve. The decision to call off the launch on Monday came two hours before the scheduled liftoff and about an hour after two NASA astronauts had strapped into the spacecraft. The postponement, blamed on a problem with a valve in the Atlas V rocket, was announced during a live NASA webcast. “Standing down on tonight’s attempt to launch,” NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post on X. “As I’ve said before, @NASA’s first priority is safety. We go when we’re ready.” It was not immediately clear how long it would take to address the problem, but the next available launch windows for the launch are Tuesday, Thursday and Friday nights. Standing down on tonight’s attempt to launch  . As I’ve said before,  ’s first priority is safety. We go when we’re ready.  — Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson)  The Starliner had been due to transport NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS), where they would have spent a week before returning to Earth. The Starliner’s inaugural voyage to the ISS has been closely watched as a sign of Boeing’s ability to rival Elon Musk’s SpaceX for NASA contracts. NASA in 2014 awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to develop space capsules for the space agency to ferry astronauts and cargo into space. The contracts marked the start of a shift by NASA towards public-private partnerships following the end of its space shuttle program. SpaceX’s Dragon successfully transported astronauts to the ISS in 2020, marking the first time NASA astronauts had launched from US soil in a commercially-built spacecraft. Starliner flew its first uncrewed mission to ISS in 2022, after an unsuccessful attempt three years earlier.

Business,"Ever since he can remember, Rohit Kumar Sahu knew he wanted to go to college and get a well-paying, white-collar job. His father delivered courier packages across the eastern Indian city of Ranchi on a bicycle, and Sahu had no idea how to realise his dream. He signed up for a job with the food delivery app Zomato, thinking this could be his path to earning money to pay for college fees. Sahu began with just a few hours of work so he could attend college alongside his job, but he could’t make enough deliveries on his bicycle — and that meant he couldn’t earn much. He took a loan from friends and a finance company and bought a scooter so he could take on more work. Even as the loan repayments kicked in, Zomato reduced its payment to delivery workers like Sahu, and he got fewer deliveries as more drivers joined the app. Sahu scaled up his work to as much as 14 hours a day, going to college only to take exams, but he still had to borrow money from his parents for loan repayments. Frustrated, Sahu and other drivers in Ranchi staged a strike asking to be paid better. But, Sahu says, company officials told them they could hire others from India’s growing army of bike riders instead and could block the strikers from the app. This broke the strike – and left Sahu with loans and his dream of college and a steady job seeming more distant than before. Sahu is among a growing number of Indians bearing the brunt of the increasing informalisation of work in India. The India Employment Report 2024, a study released in March by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Institute for Human Development, says that India’s workforce is getting more informalised and that the quality of employment has suffered especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sahu’s experience is characteristic not only of India’s growing gig economy, but also seems symptomatic of the broader employment landscape. About 70 percent of India’s construction workers and 62 percent of its casual agricultural workers earn salaries below minimum wage, found the study, which uses government data. Even in the formal sector, about 18 percent of workers did not have work contracts that could protect them. They also had fewer benefits than before, the study found. While India’s economy is pegged to grow at a robust 6.5 percent in the financial year ending March 2025, according to the United Nations Trade and Development, its ability to create quality jobs to meet the aspirations of its increasingly educated youth has emerged as one of the key issues of the national election currently under way. Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in a recent column, “With tens of millions of highly educated young people joining the workforce every year, unmet expectations and growing social unrest threaten to turn the country’s much-anticipated ‘demographic dividend’ into a disaster”. Not surprisingly, opposition leaders such as Rahul Gandhi have accused the government of “destroying employment”. INDIA bloc, the coalition of opposition parties that Gandhi’s Congress Party is a part of, has announced that it will create a right to apprenticeship that could lead to a job for young people if the coalition is elected. While recent reports have pegged employment differently, the quality of jobs seems more tenuous than before. “There has been a slippage in the quality of jobs,” said Amit Basole, head of the Centre for Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru. Ravi Srivastava, one of the lead authors of the India Employment Report and director of the  New Delhi-based Institute for Human Development’s Centre for Employment Studies, said “The share of informal workers in the economy went up.” Nearly 90 percent of the workforce is informally employed, the report says. Self-employment as a form of work grew 3.8 percentage points between 2019 and 2022, while regular employment declined to 21.5 percent from 23.8 percent. The share of casual employment declined to 22.7 percent in 2022 from 24.2 percent in 2019. Basole noted, “We see a shift since the 2000s, with a destruction of jobs at the lower end.” This trend seems to have accentuated sharply after 2019, when the pandemic hit, and millions were pushed into more insecure employment as the country went into a sudden lockdown overnight and Businesses big and small shut, with many of the latter never recovering from that shock. With workers back in their villages, agriculture saw an increase in workers of nearly 56 million from 2020 to 2022, reversing a slow trend of workers moving from agriculture into more value-added service sector jobs, the report said. Women also increasingly entered the workforce during this period, but a little more than half of them did unpaid work in agriculture, usually on family farms, Srivastava said, adding that it is a trend that has continued. “The data shows the precarity of women’s work. The degree of informality for women workers is higher than for men,” he said. Work for both men and women may have remained precarious even after the pandemic as men often returned to big cities for jobs in construction or in the gig economy, both areas with little security. The Indian government has objected to the ILO report and its employment estimates, adding that the growing gig sector was not well accounted for in the report. India’s government think-tank, NITI Aayog, estimated that 7.7 million people worked in such jobs in 2020-2021. It expects more than 23.5 million workers could be employed in gig work by 2029-2030. Srivastava says that while it is hard to estimate the number of gig workers, the total has only gone up since the pandemic. In cities, too – as not all shops, restaurants and salons had reopened – women were forced to take up gig work. In May 2022, Mumbai beautician Gurpreet Sharma’s two fingers got stuck together while fixing nail extensions for a client. Unsticking them with oil had led to swelling and burns on her fingers, limiting her ability to work or do household chores for months. Urban Company, a platform offering at-home services through which she got the job, did not provide her medical insurance since it covered only hospitalisation. Months later, with her husband’s work as an assistant dance choreographer in Bollywood getting more irregular, Sharma once again restarted work with Urban Company. A client’s dogs bit her while she was at a home pedicure appointment. She had pressed the app’s emergency button, but to no avail. The client paid for Sharma’s anti-rabies shots after she filed a police complaint. Another time, a friend accepted on the Urban Company app a job of doing a facial for a man. But she fled that client’s house unpaid because of sexual advances he made. Like Sahu, Sharma and her Urban Company colleagues have spent the last two years trying to form a union. They asked to be called employees rather than partners and get benefits accordingly, but to no avail. Pratik Mishra, of the All India Gig Workers Union, which had helped Sahu in organising efforts, said he had worked with unions in Ranchi’s large coal and steel sector for years, but what he encountered with delivery workers was like nothing he had seen before. “They were so replaceable, the company did not even consider them to be workers and they could get blocked by an algorithm anytime. They were so vulnerable.” After his fiasco with unionising, Sahu looked for other means to fund his studies and joined a loan collection agency where his job was to make calls to chase outstanding dues along with occasional food deliveries. Now 22, he has also enrolled for a master’s degree in computer applications, along with preparing for several of India’s competitive exams for coveted, and stable, federal government jobs. He can hardly afford to attend college due to work commitments, and he studies through free tutorials on YouTube. He is downbeat about his job prospects. More than 400,000 applicants take the exams for less than 12,000 government jobs. “Kya chance hai?” he asks rhetorically. “What are my chances?” Then he answers himself: “0.001 percent”. Tapping into this aspiration for government jobs, Tejashwi Yadav, the opposition leader from Sahu’s neighbouring state of Bihar, has announced that the opposition INDIA bloc will provide 10 million jobs, partly by filling open government positions. For now, Sahu worries he is not developing the skills he needs through the practical training that the college provides, but the need to earn money has limited his choices. “Hum to saari taraf se phas rahe hain [We are trapped all around],” he said, referring to his job prospects. Alexandra Hermann, lead economist in London at Oxford Economics, said a major “impediment [to creating quality jobs] has been human capital levels”. Just as Sahu worries about the skills he’s acquiring, surveys have shown that learning levels have been low in Indian schools and colleges although enrolment is up. Government spending on infrastructure development has led to the creation of construction jobs rather than the service sector jobs that India’s increasingly educated youth such as Sahu aspire to, Hermann pointed out, adding, that those are “not necessarily the kind of jobs we want”. It is time for the government to spend on improving educational levels and creating service sector jobs, she said. The Indian employment report also found that when students do get a higher education, it leads to better employment. Lal Singh, a 24-year-old from Mumbai, earned enough money from food delivery jobs to pay for courses that enabled him to become an app developer, the job he dreamed of. Growing up, Singh’s father had sold magazines at Mumbai’s busy traffic signals, and the family lived in a packed slum in the city’s southern tip. But Singh had grown up playing video games and idolising Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. While in college, he had joined a skills training course by the non-profit Antarang and found a job with a software company. While there, he continued doing courses to upgrade his skills. He now develops apps for United States companies, but is finding it hard to move to a better role in the currently tight job market. But Singh’s success is not easy to replicate. While more Indians are getting a college education than before –  and the enrollment for women in science degrees is among the highest in the world, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman – more than 83 percent of India’s unemployed are among the youth, the ILO report says. Sahu’s exam for a government job is in July, but juggling between loan collection work, deliveries, college and test preparation means he constantly feels he is failing somewhere, and the prospect of landing a good job is only getting more difficult. When things get hard, Singh occasionally turns back to food delivery.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/6/india-elections-focus-on-increasing-informalisation-of-work-for-youth,Al Jazeera,"A good, steady job?

Business,"The United States has revoked some licences that allow companies to ship goods, such as chips, to sanctioned Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei Technologies. Some companies were notified on Tuesday that their licences were revoked effective immediately, according to one person familiar with the matter. The move comes after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra 9 processor. The laptop launch drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggested that the US Department of Commerce had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to Huawei. “We have revoked certain licenses for exports to Huawei,” the Commerce Department said in a statement, declining to specify which ones it had withdrawn. The move, first reported by Reuters, comes after concerted pressure by Republican China hawks in Congress who have been urging the Biden administration to take tougher action to thwart Huawei. “This action will bolster US national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China’s ability to advance its technology,” Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said in a statement. Depending on which licences were revoked, the move could also hurt Huawei which still relies on Intel chips to power its laptops, and could hurt US suppliers that do business with the company. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment. Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Huawei was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans, part of a broader effort to handicap China’s ability to bolster its military. Being added to the list means the company’s suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain licence before shipping. Even so, suppliers to Huawei have received licences worth billions of dollars to sell Huawei goods and technology, including one particularly controversial authorization, issued by the administration of former President Donald Trump, which has allowed Intel to ship central processors to Huawei for use in its laptops since 2020. Qualcomm has sold older 4G chips to handsets since receiving a licence from US officials in 2020. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Qualcomm said it did not expect to receive more chip revenue from Huawei beyond this year. However, Qualcomm still licenses its portfolio of 5G technologies to Huawei, which last year began using a 5G chip designed by its HiSilicon unit that most analysts believe is manufactured in violation of US sanctions. Qualcomm said in the filing this month that its patent deal with Huawei expires early in Qualcomm’s fiscal 2025 and that it has started negotiations to renew the deal. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics argue such licences have contributed to the company’s resurgence. Huawei shocked the industry last August with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip manufactured by Chinese chipmaker SMIC, despite US export restrictions on both companies. The phone helped Huawei smartphone sales spike 64 percent year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint. Its smart car component business has also contributed to Huawei’s resurgence, with the company notching its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/8/us-cancels-export-licenses-of-suppliers-to-chinas-huawei,Al Jazeera,US cancels export licences of suppliers to China’s Huawei
