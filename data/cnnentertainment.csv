Entertainment,"Comedian Nikki Glaser started the week with her memorable performance roasting  Tom Brady  on Netflix and will cap it off with the debut of her new standup  special for HBO .
     
            Her sharp quips about the former NFL quarterback gained her thousands of new followers on Instagram and a hilarious appearance on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show.”
     
            Glaser, however, is taking it all in stride. She’s been doing standup long enough to know the ups and downs of the entertainment industry.
     
            “I’ve never felt like when are people gonna get it? I’m not one of those people. I always feel like I kind of am getting what I deserve. I’m not someone who’s been waiting for this my whole life,” Glaser told CNN in an interview this week. “I mean, obviously this has been the goal to be beloved on this kind of scale, but it’s also scary because when it comes on fast like this, you know, this kind of enthusiasm for someone lasts for a moment but can go away pretty quickly.”
     
            Glaser said she knew Brady’s “Greatest Roast of All Time” would land with viewers.
     
            “I knew it was a home run and I knew that the event would be special because it was live,” she said. “I had hoped it would be number one on Netflix and that there would be viral moments, but I didn’t think that I would be a big part of all that discussion.”
     
            As the roast got closer, Glaser was ran her Brady jokes in up to four sets a night in Los Angeles, “jumping from club to club.”
     
            “Working with a team of writers, we would work during the day and then we would write in between shows and treat it like I was hosting an award show,” she said. “The way I would do it if I got asked to host the Oscars, like it’s that big of a deal. So, I took it really seriously.”
     
            Glaser also took her preparations seriously for her new special, “Someday You’ll Die.” In it, she covers substantive topics like having kids, body image and death, but promises fans both old and new will find plenty of laughs, too.
     
            “It’s just a look at my life right now as I’m approaching 40 and all my friends are having kids and starting families, getting married. I don’t really have any of that,” she said. “[The special explores] how I suffer with depression, despite the fact that my life is great, my fear of death, my longing for it at times, [with] really hard jokes in between.”
     
            Glaser describes her new work as “honest, raw, really tight comedy,” two years in the making.
     
            “Someday You’ll Die” debuts May 11 on Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/nikki-glaser-new-standup-special/index.html,CNN,
Entertainment,"Editor’s note:  The following contains spoilers about the May 9 episode of “Young Sheldon.” 
     
            Anyone who watched “The Big Bang Theory” with any regularity over its 12 seasons knew what was coming as its prequel  “Young Sheldon”  comes to a close, but the knock at the door that ended the most recent episode still felt like a gut punch.
     
            As the young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) prepared to head off to college, he and his family learned that his father (Lance Barber) has died of a heart attack, the aftermath of which will be addressed in the two-part series finale on May 16.
     
            The moment seemed particularly cruel, inasmuch as the father, George Sr., had just been offered a long-sought opportunity to move up from coaching high school football into the college ranks, receiving an offer from Rice in Houston.
     
            “We always knew that there were a couple big moments that happened in Sheldon’s life, his father passes away and he goes to Caltech,” executive producer Steve Holland told CNN, adding that the decision was made to have that happen now – as opposed to during the final two episodes – so the characters could deal with its aftermath in the finale.
     
            According to Holland, series co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that schedule of events, saying that after seven seasons of comedy (allowing for the occasional poignant moment), “Maybe we don’t want to leave the audience wallowing in grief at the end.”
     
            The elder Sheldon (Jim Parsons) had referenced his father’s death, and when it happened, during “The Big Bang Theory,” although with the benefit of hindsight he wasn’t always the most reliable narrator regarding his father and his perceived shortcomings – at least, based on how they played out in the second series.
     
            Although “Young Sheldon” is wrapping up, CBS viewers haven’t seen the last of the Coopers: the network has ordered another spinoff, featuring the characters of Georgie (Montana Jordan) and Mandy (Emily Osment) for the 2024-25 TV season – “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage” – which merely adds to the needle-threading act performed by the producers.
     
            Still, any concerns about setting up what comes next didn’t play into the “Young Sheldon” ending, Holland said, noting, “We were really just focused on ending this show as strong as we could.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/young-sheldon-episode-12-shock/index.html,CNN,
Entertainment,"Fifty years ago, two Swedish married couples went on the most consequential double date in music history, changing pop for good at the  Eurovision Song Contest .
     
            True, the bar wasn’t too high. 1974 was also the year that Paul Anka topped charts with “(You’re) Having My Baby,” a track that won a 2006 CNN survey of the  worst songs of all time.  
     
            But Abba – then  still available  in human form – have remained Eurovision’s de facto godparents as the event grew into the merriest, most colorful musical competition in the world.
     
            Now, 50 years on from their “Waterloo” breakout, the contest is back in Sweden, its spiritual home, after Loreen won the country’s seventh crown last May – becoming the first woman to win the competition twice.
     
            All these storylines coming together must be fate; incontrovertible proof that God is a Eurovision fan. You couldn’t have written it any better, right Loreen?
     
            “People are like ‘OK, Sweden is the spiritual home of Eurovision’ – I see Eurovision as this moving entity,” she tells CNN. “Who cares about the place?”
     
            OK, well, that’s not quite the narrative we were going for. But Loreen – who took the sparkly baton from ABBA and is now the undisputed Queen of Eurovision – must feel a tinge of emotion when she sees those four legendary faces on billboards all over host city Malmo… right?
     
            “I’m looking at ABBA and I’m like, I want to have those pants,” she exclaims. “Those platform shoes, where can I get those?”
     
            Listen, Loreen, can you just say something nice about ABBA, so we can move on from those digitally-rendered dinosaurs and talk about the runners and riders at Eurovision this year?
     
            “It really is a work of art, what they’ve created,” Loreen says obligingly, reflecting on the foursome’s musical and stylistic output. “The whole product, ABBA, is a vibe, isn’t it?”
     
            That it is. But ABBA are the past; Baby Lasagne, Windows95Man and Nemo – a person, not a fish – are very much the present.
     
            And this year’s competition is as moving, ridiculous, naked and powerful as ever.
     
            So just in time for  Pulitzer season , CNN has taken on the earnest task of studiously watching rehearsals and carefully analyzing every song, to bring you this: the definitive guide to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.
     
            Artists have been competing in two semi-finals this week, and 26 made it to Saturday’s grand final, which starts at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. EST) in Malmo.
     
            To quote Malta’s vocal gymnast Sarah Bonnici: “Here we go aga…aaa..aaa..aa…ain, huh?”
     
            For the rest of Europe, hosting Eurovision is an unimaginable honor. For Sweden, it’s beginning to feel like that “quirky” friend’s improv troupe you’d promised you’d see, then promptly forgot about until the last minute, just as you’re stepping into a bubble bath with a glass of Pinot Grigio.
     
            This year’s fan park is  a bit budget , complain seasoned eurofans. Public rehearsals were half-full, and tickets remain for the final, with mere hours to go. Some even claim the show’s slogan - “United by Music” - may be influenced by last year’s slogan, “United by Music.”
     
            But Eurovision is a special part of the cultural calendar. “This community is the whole palette of what we are. Goofy, serious, nerdy,” Loreen says, counting adjectives on some unnecessarily long, golden fingernails. “Everything that you can imagine.”
     
            If there’s one thing the contest has taught her, it’s this: “You can actually feel real, authentic love for people that you don’t know, but you  do  know… you know?”
     
            Loreen will be performing as a guest during Saturday’s final, while 22-year-old identical twins Marcus and Martinus take the daunting mantle of competing for the host country.
     
            “We’re very competitive people; I think we’re the most competitive in the whole competition,” they say without a trace of irony.
     
            This year’s slim favorite is Baby Lasagne, whose arena-pounding anthem “Rim Tim Tagi Dim” describes a brain drain affecting Croatian towns. “Ay, I’m a big boy now; I’m going away and I sold my cow,” he chants.
     
            But Mr. Lasagne is nothing if not modest. He credits his fiancée with helping him launch his career – “She’s the lasagne, and I’m just the baby,” he tells CNN. “I don’t even like lasagne that much,” he adds, disappointingly. “I mean, it’s OK. I eat it a few times a year.”
     
            He’s juking it out with Switzerland’s Nemo, who came up with genre-bending epic “The Code” at Eurovision camp, a place whose mere mention would induce bewilderment to the non-European mind. “It was like a playground,” Nemo says. But now Nemo’s at the real thing, “and it’s even bigger and crazier than I expected it to be.”
     
            Ireland’s Bambie Thug is surging as the final approaches, and the Netherland’s Joost Klein is in with a shot. “I don’t mind winning, and I also don’t mind losing. I love being,” he says.
     
            No-one has had a bigger nightmare in Malmo than Windows95Man, whose entire persona revolves around an operating system whose name and logo cannot legally be shown at Eurovision.
     
            Teemu Keisteri, the genius behind the act, decided to wear a blurred version of the logo on his T-shirt instead. And he wears little else; Finland’s performance sees Windows95Man hatch from a giant egg, then run around with no trousers on for two minutes, before – spoiler alert – he’s eventually reunited with a pair of denim hot pants that descend from the ceiling.
     
            “In my late twenties, I figured out that I don’t need to be normal,” Windows95Man tells CNN. “I cannot control how the world sees my art.”
     
            And what is the message of this artwork, exactly? Windows95Man sums it up like this: “If Daddy is a little bit naked, it’s not so serious.” Which is not remotely a creepy thing to say.
     
            Europe is utterly obsessed with Eurovision. It’s all they think about year-round. Just ask Greece’s contestant, Marina Satti. “When I grew up I didn’t have a TV, so I kind of lost track,” she says. OK, never mind then.
     
            But more than 150 million people do watch every year. Some 129 artists entered San Marino’s national selection – around one Eurovision wannabe for every 260 people living in the microstate.
     
            And the contest is as much about the lovable weirdos as it is the winners.
     
            CNN’s prestigious, first annual award for the worst Eurovision lyric was hotly contested. We had some spectacular, cliched imagery to consider; Iceland’s Hera Bjork is “standing on the edge of a promise,” Saba is “throwing memories in the air,” and Slimane wants to “create an ocean in the fire.”
     
            “Hurricanes are roaming, but you take away the pain,” croons Azerbaijan’s  Fahree , who’s dressed like he’s come straight from the future – but not a cool part of the future, just a 23rd-century Italian restaurant with a poor hygiene rating.
     
            “Shining in a tiger’s eyes, only I can find my future,” Poland’s Luna sings, in a truly nonsensical piece of penmanship that failed to propel her to the final.
     
            But Norway’s Gåte take the crown, for this unemotional bit of scene-setting: “I was a very fine and beautiful maiden, with an evil stepmother. My mother had died,” the band explains at the start of their track. “She transformed me into a sword and a needle, and sent me off to the King’s estate.”
     
            The relentless publicists are Eurovision’s real heroes, pitching their artists in ludicrously bombastic terms. Latvia’s Dons creates “compelling, soul-stirring melodies,” we’re told. Luna “draws as much kind energy from the Moon as possible.” Armenia claims its folk-duo’s songs “have been said to transcend borders,” though it doesn’t explain who, exactly, has said this.
     
            And please make sure you’re sitting down for this – Cyprus’s Silia Kapsis, we’re informed, was once “featured in a dance documentary produced by Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.”
     
            Portugal’s Iolanda, by contrast, is hyped as …  checks notes  … “a promising singer.” Sorry, Iolanda.
     
            Eurovision’s contestants are a humble bunch; all they want to do is sing their songs and heal our planet. “I tend to believe that we can change something with this show,” Joost Klein says. “This is quantum physics, bro,” adds Loreen. “We’re balancing things up in the world right now.”
     
            One might ask: if singing can really fix the world, why don’t these people just sing more? Why do they ever stop? Why isn’t a Eurovision contestant airdropped into every conflict zone in a sequined flak jacket, to wail and emote as loud as they can, until all the world’s leader are sat around a campfire listening to Italy’s Angelina Mango strum “Wonderwall” on her guitar?
     
            The reality is that a significant portion of Eurovision’s fanbase is uncomfortable with the  participation of Israel  during the country’s war on Gaza; climate activist Greta Thunberg led an anti-war protest in Malmo on Thursday, and another is planned on Saturday to coincide with the final. Israel’s contestant Eden Golan was audibly booed during the semi-final. The  European Broadcasting Union defended the decision to keep Israel at the competition to CNN this week.
     
            But for four hours on Saturday night, much of Europe will enjoy the escape that contestants are promising to provide. They’ll sit and watch obediently as a procession of sad-looking men wail about their exes in various states of undress. They’ll cheer on fierce girlbosses and overly-coiffed double acts as they drain Malmo’s supply of dry ice. And they’ll become entranced with a new set of oddballs gunning straight for the continent’s hearts.
     
            As Loreen says: “It’s a hub of love… you wanna join?”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/eurovision-baby-lasagne-nemo-abba-preview-intl/index.html,CNN,
Entertainment,"Seven years after  a trilogy that ended  with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” didn’t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept.
     
            Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it’s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity – the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren – the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did).
     
            The audience, ultimately, will determine whether “Planet of the Apes” swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving ( not always for the better ) in a variety of ways. What’s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years.
     
            In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) – an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom – attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive.
     
            Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman ( “The Witcher’s”  Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery.
     
            A veteran of the “Maze Runner” movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language.
     
            The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing “The Planet of the Apes” but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run.
     
            Hollywood blockbusters aren’t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these “Apes” prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don’t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it’s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing.
     
             “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” premieres May 10 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/index.html,CNN,
Entertainment,"Brian Wilson , musician and founding member of the hit ’60s rock band The Beach Boys, has been placed under a conservatorship following a Los Angeles court ruling on Thursday.
     
            Judge Gus T. May of the Los Angeles Superior Court found “clear and convincing evidence” that a conservatorship is necessary, court documents said, noting that Wilson consents to the conservatorship.
     
            According to the court documents, Wilson is “unable to care for his person,” has a “Major Neurocognitive Disorder” and “lacks capacity to give informed medical consent for medications.”
     
            Wilson’s conservators are ordered to consult with his children regarding all material related healthcare decisions, the court documents said.
     
            According to the Wilson family, the decision to place Brian under a conservatorship came following the death of his wife, Melinda Wilson, in January.
     
            At the time, Wilson  called his wife his “anchor,”  saying in a post on his website that “Melinda was more than my wife. She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart.”
     
            In a  statement published in February , the Wilson family said that after “careful consideration and consultation” among Brian, his children, his housekeeper and his doctors, “longtime Wilson family representatives LeeAnn Hard and Jean Sievers will serve as Brian’s co-conservators of the person” following Melinda’s passing.
     
            This decision was made, the statement said, to “ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household,” as well as making sure that “Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by (housekeeper) Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family.”
     
            “Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses,” the family’s statement concluded.
     
            Wilson has had a tumultuous relationship with the spotlight, having suffered from fame-induced stress, depression, and drug addiction in the past. He decided to quit touring with his band after a nervous breakdown in 1964, though he continued to write, arrange, produce and record The Beach Boys’ music.
     
            Wilson and The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.
     
            Wilson has also won two Grammy Awards as a solo artist, for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005 and Best Historical Album in 2013.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/beach-boys-brian-wilson-conservatorship-judge-rules-intl-scli/index.html,CNN,
