Business,"A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.
     
            US District Judge Mark T. Pittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.
     
            These organizations, led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated.
     
            A preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.
     
            “The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”
     
            The US Chamber of Commerce has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.
     
            “It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”
     
            The rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees,” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.
     
            The  new rule would apply to large credit card issuers  — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB.
     
            The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have  fallen behind on their credit card debt  following more than two years of high inflation.
     
            The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.
     
            According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.

Business,"Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation “on pause,” after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift—and the details surrounding the donor’s previous donations.
     
            “A decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity—a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used—pending some additional information that has come to my attention,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift.
     
            It’s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU’s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university.
     
            Gregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift “breathtaking in its generosity and its scope” via a  press release  the day of the donation.
     
            But the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism.
     
            A  report   from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp. is a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
     
            In 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina’s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the  Myrtle Beach Sun News  identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials—an allegation they denied.
     
            At an emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU board of trustee and foundation members expressed their concerns and frustration about the school’s vetting process involving Gerami’s donation.
     
            Several members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement.
     
            “This meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,” Gibbons told CNN. “We are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn’t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”
     
            Gibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction.
     
            “I hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing   you do …   Vet the individual. You vet the donation,” Vice Chair Gibbons said.
     
            Board Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement   to CNN on Friday saying, “Serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.”
     
            “I regrettably share these concerns” Harper added.
     
            On May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a  statement via X (formerly Twitter)  insisting the university had done its “due diligence.” The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month.
     
            A non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university’s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday.
     
            “In addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami’s background,” Friday-Stroud said.
     
            “We had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, ‘ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,” Friday-Stroud added.
     
            “My concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,” said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold.
     
            When reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.  He referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN’s questions on the following day, but he couldn’t be reached.
     
            FAMU’s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has scheduled a  meeting for May 15  to discuss the donation.
     
            FAMU’s communications department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/florida-a-and-m-pauses-donation/index.html,CNN,Florida A&M pauses purported $237.75 million donation after questions about validity
Business,"McDonald’s and other fast food chains  are charging more . So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.
     
            “You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”
     
            If Peyton’s sales pitch   resonates with customers, it   could help convince diners   to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.
     
            For a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals,  they’re eating more at home  and spending less when they do go out.
     
            That means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.

       Restaurants are competing for frugal diners’ dollars 
     
            Because fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.
     
            The overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.
     
            Applebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.
     
            For them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.
     
            Years of price hikes have  contributed to declining traffic , pushing   restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to Henkes.
     
            “It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said. “You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”
     
            Fast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”
     
            In the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.
     
            A few years ago, McDonald’s  said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers . But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.

            CEO Chris Kempczinski said  during a February analyst call  that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded  during another analyst call  that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”
     
            The chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers,  according to Bloomberg .
     
            Things aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.
     
            Sales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year   slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.
     
            “For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”
     
            He added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”
     
            With fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.
     
            People have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels,  some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns . Chili’s has been paying attention.
     
            “Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.
     
            The chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.
     
            On X, Chili’s  asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food , and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.
     
            But it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.
     
            One problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.
     
            “People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” he noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.
     
            Still, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its   food is relatively cheap.
     
            “Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/applebees-chilis-mcdonalds-prices/index.html,CNN,Fast food is expensive. Applebee’s and Chili’s are moving in
