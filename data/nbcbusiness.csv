Business,"A Panera Bread spokesperson says the restaurant chain is phasing out its Charged Lemonade, a highly caffeinated beverage that has been blamed for at least two deaths in lawsuits. The beverages prompted controversy in October following a lawsuit filed by the family of 21-year-old   a University of Pennsylvania student with a heart condition who died after consuming Charged Lemonade. A second lawsuit was filed in December by the family of  , a Florida man with a chromosomal deficiency disorder and a developmental delay who also died after drinking a Charged Lemonade. A third lawsuit was filed in January by Lauren Skerritt, a 28-year-old  , which claimed the beverage left her with “permanent cardiac injuries.” A spokesperson for Panera said Tuesday that the nationwide discontinuation of the Charged Lemonade comes after a “recent menu transformation.”  “We listened to more than 30,000 guests about what they wanted from Panera, and are focusing next on the broad array of beverages we know our guests desire — ranging from exciting, on-trend flavors, to low sugar and low-caffeine options,” the spokesperson said.  Panera declined to say when the Charged Lemonade would be completely removed from menus. Sarah Katz's mother, Jill Katz, said Wednesday that she was relieved that the chain had decided to discontinue the drink.   ""It's a good thing,"" Katz said in a phone interview. ""But I'm sad, because I wish they came to this conclusion before they put this product on the market."" Panera   as “Plant-based and Clean with as much caffeine as our Dark Roast coffee.” But the lawsuits said that at 390 milligrams, a large, 30-fluid-ounce Charged Lemonade has more caffeine in total than any size of Panera’s dark roast coffee, referring to the amount of caffeine that is in the drink with no ice. Panera has since updated its   to reflect how much caffeine is in the Charged Lemonade with ice, listing the large size of the blood orange Charged Lemonade, for example, as having 302 milligrams. According to the  , healthy adults can generally safely consume 400 milligrams of caffeine a day.  After NBC News broke news last year of the Katz family's lawsuit, which referred to Charged Lemonade as “a dangerous energy drink,” Panera put more detailed disclosures in all of its restaurants and on its website warning customers to consume Charged Lemonade in moderation,   for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant or nursing women.  Sarah Katz's mother Jill said her daughter avoided all energy drinks because of her heart condition, long QT syndrome, which she was diagnosed with as a young child. Jill Katz said that there was ""no way that she had any clue"" that the Charged Lemonade had so much caffeine. Panera has previously expressed sympathy for the Katz and the Brown families.  , it said in a statement that it felt the customer’s “unfortunate passing was not caused by one of the company’s products” and said that it stands by the safety of the items on its menu. The restaurant chain did not comment on the third lawsuit.  On Monday evening, two Panera employees who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity because they feared they could lose their jobs confirmed that they had received memos earlier in the day from staff above them stating that their restaurants would no longer be ordering ingredients to make Charged Lemonade.  The memos, which were shared with NBC News, came from a manager in one case and a regional manager in another case, the employees said. One memo said the Charged Lemonade would be replaced within two weeks. The first employee identified himself as an associate at a Panera restaurant in Missouri, while the other said she was a manager at a Panera in Pennsylvania.  But not all Panera employees were immediately aware of the change. At a Panera restaurant in the Queens borough of New York City on Tuesday morning, three associates said they had not heard that the Charged Lemonade would be discontinued.  Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC, who represents the plaintiffs in the three lawsuits, said Tuesday that Panera had taken a “good step.”  “This is exactly what we set out to do, to some extent, is to make sure that this poison is taken off the shelves,” she said in an exclusive interview. “Obviously, it won’t bring back Sarah, and it won’t bring back Dennis, and the life that Lauren used to have.”  “But at least what it will do is prevent this from happening to someone else,” she said.

Business,"Applebee’s and IHOP owner  thinks its deals can lure away fast-food customers who have grown frustrated with menu prices. As   their restaurant spending, Applebee’s and IHOP are fighting against a larger group of rivals than usual for a smaller pool of customers. Dine Brands CEO John Peyton said full-service restaurants, fast-food chains and even eating at home are all competing for diners’ dollars. To rise above the competition, Applebee’s has been leaning into value with a slate of promotions that includes the return of Dollaritas, which makes Peyton confident that it can beat out the fast-food chains vying for its customers. “The Whole Lotta Burger for $9.99 — if you can have our burger for $10, which is great quality, abundant and eat in our restaurant, in our experience, why would you eat a $10 burger out of a paper bag in your car?” he told CNBC. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and spent more carefully when they did eat out in the first quarter, according to Peyton. Consumers with incomes under $50,000 account for about 40% to 50% of Dine’s customers, he said. Dine Brands reported first-quarter   that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates, and both Applebee’s and IHOP’s   more than expected. Still, Dine reiterated its full-year outlook and said sales have improved sequentially. Shares of the company closed roughly flat. But it’s too soon to tell if Dine will succeed in winning over diners — and investors. The company will need to improve its same-store sales growth significantly to meet the full-year outlook it reiterated this year, Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro wrote in a research note on Wednesday.

Besides leaning into deals, Applebee’s might also get an edge on the competition from a triad of recent pop-culture moments: a pivotal cameo in the tennis drama film “Challengers,” an Applebee’s-motivated meltdown on “Survivor” and a shoutout from football legend Peyton Manning during Netflix’s roast of his former rival Tom Brady.

That effort, which   between venues in Texas and Washington, D.C., for weeks, is now about to reach a milestone: a judge in the Northern District of Texas is expected to announce by Friday evening whether the court will grant the industry’s request for a freeze. That could hold up the regulation, which would   what most banks can charge in late fees to $8 per incident, just days before it was to   on Tuesday. “We should get some clarity soon about whether the rule is going to be allowed to go into effect,” said  , lead policy analyst at Wolfe Research. The credit card regulation is part of President   broader election-year war against what he deems  . Big card issuers have steadily raised the cost of late fees since 2010, profiting off users with low credit scores who   $138 in fees annually per card on average,  to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. As expected, the industry has mounted a campaign to derail the regulations, deeming them a misguided effort that   costs to those who pay their bills on time, and ultimately harms those it purports to benefit by making it more likely for users to fall behind. Up for grabs is the   in fees per year that the CFPB estimates the rule would save American families by pushing down late penalties to $8 from a typical $32 per incident.

They could do so by raising interest rates, adding new fees for things like paper statements, or changing who they choose to lend to. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said last month that, if implemented, the CFPB rule would impact his bank’s revenue for a “couple of years” as the company takes “mitigating actions” to raise revenue elsewhere. “Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway,” Fairbank told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out.” Like some   observers, Wolfe Research’s Marcus believes the Chamber of Commerce is likely to prevail in its efforts to hold off the rule, either via the Northern District of Texas or through the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. If granted, a preliminary injunction could hold up the rule until the dispute is settled, possibly through a lengthy trial. The industry group, which includes Washington, D.C.-based trade associations like the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association, filed its lawsuit in Texas because it is widely viewed as a friendlier venue for corporations, Marcus said. “I would be very surprised if [Texas Judge Mark T.] Pittman denies that injunction on the merits,” he said. “One way or another, I think implementation is going to be blocked before the rule is supposed to go into effect.” The CFPB declined to comment, and the Chamber of Commerce didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/cfpb-rule-americans-10-billion-year-late-fees-faces-possible-last-minu-rcna151523,NBC,CFPB rule to save Americans $10 billion a year in late fees faces possible last-minute freeze

According to papers filed in Los Angeles federal court, Hyundai Capital America violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act between 2015 and 2023 by repossessing 26 vehicles whose owners had begun paying off their loans prior to active duty. The Justice Department said the law required the financing arm to obtain court permission before repossessing vehicles. It cited as an example the 2017 repossession and sale of Navy Airman Jessica Johnson’s three-year-old Hyundai Elantra, after the financing arm determined that she was on active duty but “not deployed.” Johnson still owed $13,796 on the car, and Hyundai Capital America realized in 2020 it should not have repossessed it, court papers show. “Members of our Armed Forces should not have to worry about having their cars repossessed while they are in military service,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement. Without admitting wrongdoing, Hyundai Capital America will pay $10,000 plus lost vehicle equity to each of the 26 service members, and repair their credit. It will also pay $74,941 to the U.S. Treasury “to vindicate the public interest.” Hyundai Capital America is based in Irvine, California. “HCA takes pride in supporting our military families,” it said in a statement. “Additionally, we have already taken steps to further enhance our compliance with all SCRA requirements.” The Justice Department in the last several years settled claims under the servicemembers law against several financing companies, including General Motors, Nissan and Wells Fargo financing arms.

Business,"Some customers of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX could receive the full value of the money they lost if a court approves the company's bankruptcy plan. However, they will not see the gains on their holdings of bitcoin and other digital assets that have occurred over the past two years, despite massive increases in the value of those financial instruments since the FTX exchange collapsed in November 2022. According to   filed Tuesday by FTX, which is going through reorganization, 98% of FTX creditors, including individual investors, who had $50,000 or less with the company will receive the funds they lost, in cash, within 60 days of a reorganization plan going into effect. The plan must still be approved by a court and by creditors.  “We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,"" said John J. Ray III, who took over as chief executive officer of FTX alongside his role as chief restructuring officer. That plan is possible mostly because FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, held a number of other assets that the reorganization team has sold off. These included shares in Anthropic, the Amazon-backed artificial intelligence startup now valued at nearly $20 billion. FTX said it had sold shares in the company worth $900 million this year. But some claimants have objected to their crypto assets being valued at November 2022 prices as part of the bankruptcy. Since that date, the price of bitcoin has climbed more than 250%. In February, the Justice Department appointed an independent examiner, Robert Cleary, to review potential issues with parties involved in the bankruptcy, including past investigations into the FTX debtors and potential conflicts of interest in the FTX bankruptcy involving FTX’s law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell. A spokesperson for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Adam Moskowitz, a lawyer representing some of the FTX bankruptcy claimants, said that even with the unusually generous returns to the claimants outlined by the company, outstanding questions about the bankruptcy process remain. ""We have serious concerns,"" Moskowitz said. The Sullivan and Cromwell law firm has denied any wrongdoing.  FTX acknowledged that some claimants might find the value of what's coming back to them through the bankruptcy to be insufficient. But at the time of its collapse, the release said, FTX held ""only 0.1% of the Bitcoin and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held."" Because of that, FTX — referred to as a debtor in the bankruptcy case — has ""not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the chapter 11 cases,"" the news release said.

Business,"LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday announced a widely expected hold on interest rates as it said restrictive monetary policy was taming inflation, but warned a June rate cut was not a done deal. Members of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to hold, with the latter favoring a cut. In the prior meeting only one member voted for a cut. The MPC nonetheless cautioned that indicators of inflation persistence “remain elevated,” highlighting that services inflation came in at 6% in March, and that there are “upside risks” to the near-term outlook from geopolitics. It said it would monitor upcoming data releases closely. Two consumer price index prints are due before its next meeting on June 20. The decision keeps the BOE’s key Bank Rate at 5.25%. “We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,” BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement reported by Reuters. “I’m optimistic that things are moving in the right direction.” Market anticipation has been building for interest rate cuts to begin in the summer, with money markets fully pricing in a 25 basis point reduction in August and 50 basis points overall this year. Some economists see a cut in June and three or more cuts in 2024, though market pricing suggested a 45% probability of that following the meeting. U.K. headline inflation is forecast to drop dramatically in April due to lower energy prices, from the   to below the BOE’s 2% target, according to some projections. In its Thursday release, the BOE said it expected it expected the U.K. gross domestic product to grow by 0.4% in the first quarter of the year, and by 0.2% in the second quarter. The economy   in the second half of 2023. It meanwhile sees headline inflation close to 2% in the near-term, and expects it to increase slightly later in the year as the drag from the energy market wanes. In a press conference following the announcement, Bailey emphasized the message in its statement that the MPC “will consider forthcoming data releases and how these inform the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding.” “June is not a fait accompli, but each meeting is a new decision,” he said. Paul Dales, chief U.K. economist at Capital Economists, noted the BOE had repeated previous messaging on monetary policy remaining restrictive for “sufficiently long” and for “an extended period.” This “suggests to us that the Bank is not implying it will cut rates at the next policy meeting in June,” he said in a note. “But the new line that the MPC will ‘consider forthcoming data releases and how these inform the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding’ implies that the MPC is willing to change its stance and that the data will determine when that happens.” Wage data may end up informing whether the cut falls in June or August, he added.

Business,"Mortgage rates are significantly higher than they were at the start of this year, but they pulled back slightly last week after several weeks of straight increases. That was enough to spark some new demand, especially for refinances. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.18% from 7.29%, with points unchanged at 0.65 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. “Treasury rates and mortgage rates fell last week on the news of a slowing  , with wage growth at the slowest pace since 2021, and the  ’s announced plans to ease quantitative tightening in June and to maintain its view that another rate hike is unlikely,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s senior vice president and chief economist. The rate for Federal Housing Administration loans fell below 7% for the first time in three weeks, which is a welcome sign for first-time buyers, who tend to use FHA loans. “First-time homebuyers account for roughly half of purchase loans, and the government lending programs are an important source of financing for these homebuyers. The gain in FHA activity is a sign that this segment of the market is active,” Fratantoni added. The dip in rates caused refinance demand to increase 5% for the week, although it was still 6% lower than the year-earlier week. Rates are 70 basis points higher than they were a year ago, so there are very few borrowers who can benefit from a refinance. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 2% for the week but were still 17% lower than the same week a year earlier. Affordability is hitting potential buyers hard, as   continue to climb. Tight supply is keeping the competition high, resulting in very few bargains. Mortgage rates fell further to start this week.

The investor,  , had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,  , at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former President  , who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March. Public trading of the company’s stock under the new ticker DJT began a day later. Last week, the   charged Trump Media’s auditor with what the regulator said was  nvolving the auditor’s accounting work for hundreds of publicly traded companies, affecting 1,500 SEC filings.

Business,"A new strategy has emerged in the battle to ban smoking in casinos: the shareholder vote. Shareholders at  ,   and   will put on the ballot at the respective casino companies proposals to force them to study the costs associated with permitting smoking indoors — and whether going smoke-free could save money. The proposals are sponsored by Trinity Health, a nonprofit health care network, and the Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation. Trinity Health, based in Livonia, Michigan, has used its shareholder status to   despite the fact that it owns just a tiny fraction of these companies. For example, public records show Trinity owns just 440 shares of Bally’s stock, or about 0.001% of the company. Boyd, Bally’s and Caesars fought to keep the proposals out of the proxy materials distributed to shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission denied the casinos’ requests, and the proposals as well as the rationale behind them were delivered to all shareholders. Boyd will face a   at its annual shareholder meeting Thursday. Bally’s holds its annual meeting on May 16, and Caesars will follow with its own meeting, likely in June. The three companies collectively operate 75 U.S. casinos that permit indoor smoking, where state law allows. About 14 states permit indoor smoking in commercial casinos. States like Nevada and New Jersey have prohibited indoor smoking more broadly but carved out exceptions for casinos. Legislation to end indoor smoking at casinos is in various stages in several states across the country, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Advocates for smoking bans point to research by C3 Gaming that concluded smoke-free casinos generate more revenue and outperform competitors that allow smoking. Proposal sponsors argue shareholders should know how much casinos pay in higher health insurance premiums for employees, greater maintenance costs and keeping away customers who hate the smoke. In its proxy, Boyd argues it’s seen a negative impact in states that banned indoor smoking. It argues these decisions are best left up to the properties to follow local trends and says if shareholders succeed in implementing a ban (which Boyd claims is the true goal in forcing an assessment), the company will lose customers to competitors who continue to allow smoking. Caesars board member Jan Jones Blackhurst said Wednesday at the SBC Summit North America, an online gaming conference, that she believes the decision of whether to ban smoking in casinos should be left up to governments. She pointed out that experience has shown that smoke-free casinos can take an economic hit. “Generally, if you look across the United States, when casinos prohibit smoking, revenues fall anywhere from 20% to 25%, which also then have a huge layoff factor with people starting to lose their jobs,” she said. Unions are mixed in their responses. While some worry about the potential of job losses, the United Auto Workers, which represents more than 10,000 table game dealers across the country, has ramped up its efforts in the fight against in-casino smoking, citing secondhand exposure for employees. The   says “no amount of exposure to secondhand smoke is safe and the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is through 100% smoke free indoor air environments.” The U.S. surgeon general says that many common practices found in casinos such as separating smoking versus non-smoking sections, cleaning the air and ventilating buildings are not effective protections against secondhand smoke. Casino operator Parx, which runs locations in Pennsylvania, decided to stay smoke-free during the Covid pandemic at its property in Bensalem, north of Philadelphia. It competes with four other local casinos that allow smoking indoors but said it hasn’t seen its market share suffer. “Financially, we know we’ve lost some customers, but we also know we’ve gained some customers. We don’t think we’ve seen a significant impact either way,” Parx spokesperson Marc Oppenheimer told CNBC. Instead, the company said it focuses on guest satisfaction scores and surveys that indicate a boost to employee morale. In Las Vegas,   opened the first casino resort on the Strip to prohibit indoor smoking and even smoking on the pool deck. On its website, the property declares, “Here at Park MGM, we’re not afraid to be different and, as you may have noticed, we’re all about what’s fresh. Now, that includes the air you breathe.” For now, Park MGM is the exception, but smoke-free advocates hope soon, it’ll be the rule.
